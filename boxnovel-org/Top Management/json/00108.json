If you still want to, there\u2019s a limit to what you can learn in Team 3. While the people there might be veterans in the music industry, the acting industry is a completely different ballgame. If you want to learn properly before it\u2019s too late, then you need to transfer quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader said as though he was sincerely concerned about my career.</p><br/><p>To be honest, his words were quite persuasive since there were more times where Chief Lee Bongjoon\u2019s advice was more helpful than Kim Hyunjo\u2019s while we were filming the drama.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, if you transfer, you can still take care of Lee Songha like now. There are cases where chiefs take care of two to three people if they have the capacity so you can also experience taking care of another actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was he trying to fool? Did he think I was fool ignorant of the world?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat other actor, is it Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, our top star who no one can handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader said while slowly rubbing his beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, it\u2019ll be too much for you to be assigned to both Lee Songha and Son Chaeyoung. I\u2019ll assign you a skilled chief to help you and share your workload. If you do this, you\u2019ll have my full support.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice sounded kind on purpose.</p><br/><p>With an awkward expression, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cPutting aside the fact that the relationship between Lee Songha and Son Chaeyoung is so bad that it can\u2019t get any worse, I don\u2019t like Ms. Son Chaeyoung. How could I work with her like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you? It\u2019s just work.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader leaned towards me. His eyes shined sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but Son Chaeyoung is interested in you. Just think of it as using that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard it as though he was throwing me in like a toy to placate the angry Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut everything else aside, and think about what will be more beneficial to you. Your career will be more robust, and I\u2019ll think of you as one of my own from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haha, that was the most ridiculous thing I heard all year.</p><br/><p>What \u2018think of me as his own\u2019? Either way, Im Joowon\u2019s contract was proceeding smoothly thanks to me, yet this man was trying to push me to Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>Maybe if we could maintain a relationship where we didn\u2019t bicker every time we saw each other, but he wasn\u2019t someone I could trust and follow from the start. I still vividly remembered how he pushed all the responsibility onto and fired the road manager during the Sung Dowon incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, that actor you brought, depending on how you do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An unpleased expression flashed on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could get you a contract right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Mr. Nam Joyoon a kind of reward? If I refuse your proposal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no contract. From our meeting, our opinion is heavily leaning towards not recruiting him. Despite his lackluster profile, I called him for a meeting because he\u2019s the next actor this guy who\u2019s known for his discerning eye is fixated on. I was still disappointed after meeting him. Our mailboxes are filled with actors like him. On top of that, he filed a lawsuit against his previous company.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mind went blank.</p><br/><p>After clicking his tongue, the team 2 leader returned to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you a lot with this. That\u2019s why come to Team 2. Do you und-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile faded from the team 2 leader\u2019s face when he heard me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if it wasn\u2019t for Chaeyoung, do you think I would listen to your circumstances and take care of you like this? I\u2019ve taken your circumstances into consideration the best I can, which is why-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile I am thankful for your words, I want to keep working in my current team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meaning you should clean up your own mess.</p><br/><p>While I wanted to say that, I stored it away for another day. However, the team 2 leader\u2019s face flushed with anger at my refusal. Agitated, he stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike before and now, you are still someone who can\u2019t receive anything even when spoon-fed.\u201d</p><br/><p>How laughable.</p><br/><p>That was what I should say.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, running crew! Quickly load the opened props in the van!\u201d</p><br/><p>The film set was being torn down after the filming was over.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon was carrying boxes filled with props. His face, neck, and even muscular back were soaked with sweat.</p><br/><p>He wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand as he stretched his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just need to carry these, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>He asked while stacking a few boxes.</p><br/><p>When he finally noticed me, his eyes became round.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour friend said you\u2019d be here so I came over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come all the way here? You could have just called and I would have gone to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was nearby so I came over to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had to work to earn his food money so how could I make him skip a day?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen please wait over there for a moment. After I carry thi-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be faster if I help out. We can talk longer the faster we finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>While carrying boxes with Nam Joyoon, who was acting awkward, I went to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon flinched while placing down boxes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe meeting. The results came out, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><br/><p>After loading everything, Nam Joyoon brought over a plastic chair from behind the film set and sat me down. Then he handed me a bottle of water and a roll of gimbap he obtained as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could have told me on the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He roughly brushed away the dusty floor before sitting down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress it. It\u2019s not my first time experiencing this. I was happy that I met someone who remembered me from a project I was cast in when I was youn-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this and give it a read.\u201d</p><br/><p>While chewing on a piece of cold gimbap, I handed him a scenario that I took out from my bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new project from Pan Production. I know their CEO well. There\u2019s a role I marked on there. If you like it as well, I can try to get you an audition.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more I talked, the more confused Nam Joyoon\u2019s expression became.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really understand, but what are yo-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI am trying to entice you right now. To work with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon began to cough as if something was caught in his throat. While smiling, I handed him the bottle of water.</p><br/><p>To be honest, I came after receiving the team 3 leader\u2019s approval. I asked if he could let me take care of an actor outside work, making sure this didn\u2019t interfere with Neptune.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no contract, and I won\u2019t be able to use W&amp;U\u2019s background, but it\u2019ll be better than working on your own. While it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to say this, I hear that I\u2019m quite good at my job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon let out a breath after gulping down half the water bottle. Various emotions arose in his barren eyes. As if he didn\u2019t know what to do, Nam Joyoon roughly tangled his hair as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you\u2026 As a chief, you should have better candidates than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for you, but for me. I have something I want to confirm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon looked at me with eyes asking what I meant.</p><br/><p>Smiling faintly, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to confirm if my discerning eye is any good.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Thud. Lee Songha chopped down with a kitchen knife.</p><br/><p>The head of the small octopus on the cutting board was cleanly cut off. After filming that with the camcorder, I moved on. The other girls all had aprons and were working hard to make the kitchen a mess.</p><br/><p>They were asked to bring their own lunchbox for the program they were appearing on as a guest tomorrow, but I was concerned whether it was okay to hand this over to the staff. It was a complete crisis. When there were four girls living together, it was likely that one would be good at cooking.</p><br/><p>Sweating as she handled the rice, Im Seoyoung shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, please! Stop laughing! Cooking is all about confidence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee what you made and tell me it\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought she said she was going to make a cat face with fried rice, but she made it looked like a monster that would appear in nightmares.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is good for an amateur!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s good, then the picture I took worthy of the Pulitzer Prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really! What? Do you think you can do better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung halted. The other girls also stopped what they were doing and looked at me. Lee Taehee threw out the eggs she messed up trying to separate into yolk and whites as she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how to cook?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, no? You said you don\u2019t cook when you\u2019re living alone! I remember you saying that you received side dishes from home and your brother\u2019s family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a bother and I\u2019m busy. How could I not know how to could after living with four kids who ate like pigs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-then do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I put on plastic gloves. Suddenly Lee Songha began hurriedly looking around the sink before handing me something.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, here. Put this on while you cook.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an apron. A hand-sized one with a rabbit drawn on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get your clothes dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, put it away. It\u2019s probably better to cook without my clothes than wear that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Above all, LJ picked up the camcorder the moment you handed it to me.</p><br/><p>I turned a disappointed Lee Songha away and handled rice for once after a long time. I put the fried rice in the lunchbox, formed it into a cat shape, then cut seaweed into its whiskers, eyes, nose, mouth. I was finished in a jiffy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, it\u2019s done. A cat, easy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all! It\u2019s not easy at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>I helped the other girls with their lunchboxes a little as well. I didn\u2019t plan on it, but Lee Songha kept admiring from behind whenever I did something.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop staring. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing something amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks amazing to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you flatter me, there isn\u2019t any for you. I only bought the precise amount of ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s always hungry or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha mumbled. At her words, not just me, but all the other girls, who had been working hard on their lunchboxes, burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s say that. Can you roll up my sleeves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sleeves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey keep sliding down. If your hands are dirty, then Taehe-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha gripped my forearm. Then she steadily rolled up my sleeves with a very serious face, as if she was some sleeve-rolling expert. Her soft, delicate hands brushed my arms. From my elbow, she gradually rolled my sleeves higher and higher.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. How high are you going to roll them? Up to my shoulders?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed unintentional as she blinked before stopping.</p><br/><p>I left the kitchen and held the camcorder again.</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 expressions were bright. Maybe it was because of his betrayal or some other reason, but the mood had been a little strange since the traitor was fired. I didn\u2019t know whether they were hiding their complicated thoughts, but they looked no different from normal.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung closed her lunchbox before saying as though she just thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, oppa. You know. I think we\u2019ve become too used to working with you. It was really awkward when Kim Hyunjo oppa came by himself last time. Maybe it\u2019s because we think of you as good luck, but it felt like we weren\u2019t doing as well either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s troublesome if you don\u2019t do well. After handing over my duties, I\u2019ll only be coming to big schedules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung was shocked. The other girls were the same.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was the only one who looked fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so surprised? I was promoted to chief. I\u2019ll be busy from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s right. You\u2019re a chief now. I guess you can\u2019t be demoted?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. My salary increased too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do after throwing us aside?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could reply, in an excited voice, Lee Songha said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably busy because of me. I have to go to China to promote the drama, set my next project and begin filming. Like while I was filming the drama, the two of us will have lots of work to do from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face brightened at my reply.</p><br/><p>I suddenly recalled Nam Joyoon, who I met earlier. While I wasn\u2019t assigned to him officially, they would probably meet each other from now on.</p><br/><p>While the other girls were singers, he overlapped with Lee Songha so I had to take special care, especially since there were cases where she was anxious I would be assigned to another celebrity in the past.</p><br/><p>I considered telling them but ultimately decided against it. She seemed to be in a good mood so I should tell her later.</p><br/><p>Also, she was holding a kitchen knife.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Songha, were there any synopses you liked out of the ones you read?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a few I enjoyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha quickly rushed to her room.</p><br/><p>When I followed her, she handed me a few stacks of paper. The project I had a hard time picking was there too. While thinking that it was a relief, I looked at a few others before realizing what they had in common.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are all very melodramatic. You prefer these?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flipping through each one, I halted on the last scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s a bit. It\u2019s a passionate melodrama. If you decide on this one, we probably can\u2019t read the script dialogue together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprised, Lee Songha\u2019s eyes became round.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? We read the script every night last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned as I added,</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, I read this scenario as well. There\u2019s dialogue like \u2018I love you. I can\u2019t live without you,\u2019 starting halfway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to read your counterpart\u2019s dialogue. Won\u2019t it be too funny to concentrate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s expression became odd. It seemed she was imagining us reading the script together as her well-formed brows and lips twitched a few times.</p><br/><p>Soon, she broke the silence and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why? Why is it funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was with her reaction?</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-107\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 107\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-109\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 109\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201329\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

The sea is freaking deep blue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you call it deep blue? So unromantic. It\u2019s cobalt blue, cobalt blue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, just wait until you hit your thirties. Let\u2019s see how much you like \u2018romantic\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and Lee Kwanwoo, who were both squeezed in the back seat, whispered to each other.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo, having returned to being a romantic, admired the Mediterranean Sea, taking it all in. Kim Hyunjo was swearing about how he was being crushed as his shoulders were grabbed by Lee Kwanwoo.</p><br/><p>The stylists and artists\u2019 gazes were glued to the opposite windows.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy! Isn\u2019t he Kieron Wood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere? Where? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one next to the Ferrari!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one? There\u2019s so many!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! The one holding the beach towel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh, no, he isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were disappointed for a moment before quickly chattering while looking at another direction. It hadn\u2019t been that long since they resolved themselves, saying that they weren\u2019t here for leisure but for work and how they couldn\u2019t be pushed around by foreign staff. Anyone looking at them now would think they were tourists.</p><br/><p>Well, it was understandable.</p><br/><p>The streets were lined with Ferraris, Maseratis, Bentleys, and other luxury cars I didn\u2019t know the names of. There were lots of men and women whose looks would give actors a run for their money. Anyone visiting here won\u2019t be able to help but look around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll probably be quite a few unknown or aspiring actors among them.\u201d</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s project producer said quietly, seeming having heard them admiring their surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the famous film directors, production companies, and agencies gather here at this time of year. Around 4,000 top reporters from various countries arrive as well. It\u2019s a land of opportunities in many respects. For us as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mumbling project producer looked towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung, you said it\u2019s your first time in Cannes, but how are you so calm? Some might think you\u2019re a local.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it look like that? I\u2019m actually quite excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer laughed as if he didn\u2019t believe me.</p><br/><p>Even though I was trying to calm my overflowing emotions by counting palm trees.</p><br/><p>Boulevard de la Croisette look like an enormous film set.</p><br/><p>A film set that took an exorbitant amount of money to build. It looked like it would suit a more historical drama than a modern one. Vintage European buildings lined up neatly on the street. There were even magnificent buildings that reminded you of medieval castles.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup gawked as he took in the sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are palaces on the street.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are all hotels.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer made a crooked smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMajestic, Martinez, Carlton. All 5-star hotels. The film festival only provides such accommodations to really high-level individuals, so all the amazing guys are over there. The entrances are packed with paparazzi and spectators. They\u2019ll spend all day to get a glance of a celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rooms there must be crazy expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re expensive, but you can\u2019t even rent one even if you have the money at this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup glanced at the sedan driving in front of us and the hotels before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying the people in there are receiving the best treatment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey divide the treatment in there too. Some get suite rooms, while others get regular rooms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll keep them motivated at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>While we were busy looking at the historic hotels, the sedan in front of us came to a stop. While the hotel we stopped at wasn\u2019t at the same level as the castles we passed, it still had a grand appearance. The large, white columns supporting the entrance reminded me of a temple.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo admired the sight as he was taking off his seatbelt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is really good too though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it is provided by the film festival. A night here would probably cost a million won.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup\u2019s eyes curved into smiles at the project producer\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, how wonderful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThough we only have three days, so we\u2019ll be chased out the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have anything in the past. Production companies emptied their pockets to get actors rooms, and the staff rented a small apartment and had multiple members sleeping on each bed. Considering that they provided us with a hotel room, their treatment of us has gotten much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh-oh, how great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThough they only provided them to the actors and director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then the staff?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe reserved a residence nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer chuckled after manipulating Kim Hyunsup\u2019s emotions.</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why did the film festival only provide the rooms for three days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur official schedule ends by then. However, because the award ceremony is done at the same time as the closing ceremony, we have to wait until then. While holding our breaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will we only get to see the closing ceremony if we don\u2019t win an award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t get an award, we can\u2019t go to the closing ceremony. It\u2019s an event we can only attend if we\u2019re invited.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood in the van chilled. The project producer let out a stuffy laugh.</p><br/><p>Although they said to be prepared since Cannes was a society divided into different classes, to think that the treatment was so different. I researched a lot and prepared myself before coming here, but it stung even more now that I was actually experiencing it.</p><br/><p>As soon as the sedan marked with a palm tree leaf, the symbol of the Cannes Film Festival, arrived, a hotel security guard came over. At the same time, the paparazzi and spectators rushed over. I acted quickly because I had experienced similar scenarios back in Korea and China, but it was for naught.</p><br/><p>The spectators diligently followed the \u2018Do not approach\u2019 sign of the security guard.</p><br/><p>Their gazes as they looked at Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon lit up in interest for a moment before fading away. I had told Lee Songha to keep her sunglasses on just in case, but it seemed that wasn\u2019t needed either.</p><br/><p>I heard English occasionally mixed in with the French words.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know who they are. I don\u2019t know which country they are from and what they are doing here. I don\u2019t know whether they are actors or from production companies. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><br/><p>I even heard a paparazzi complain about why nobodies were riding in the film festival cars and confusing everyone. I made sure to remember his face.</p><br/><p>As mentioned, the film festival provided exactly three rooms.</p><br/><p>When Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon found out they were the only ones staying here, they said that they would rather stay at the group residence. We managed to push them into the hotel and unpacked in the residence SBE Film had reserved for us.</p><br/><p>After that, we were on such a tight schedule that we didn\u2019t have time to go sightseeing.</p><br/><p>The press conference at the Palais des Festivals was just the beginning. Since Director Oh Hyunkyung and Nam Joyoon were weak to the simultaneous translations of French and English, Lee Songha, who was fluent in English, was pretty much dragged to all the conferences.</p><br/><p>Yet, she was the number one on the list of Neptune members who shouldn\u2019t do interviews.</p><br/><p>It seemed I was worried for nothing as it looked like she left a favorable impression on the reporters.</p><br/><p>We received quite a few interview requests after the conferences.</p><br/><p>The production company and distribution company set up a booth in the film market located in the basement of the Palais des Festivals and jumped into making sales. We kept on top of all the interviews. Everyone\u2019s faces showed signs of chronic fatigue after working to death for the past two days.</p><br/><p>The only one who still seemed too energetic was Lee Songha yet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, what\u2019s after this interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her energy was quickly being depleted from the never-ending relay of events.</p><br/><p>While we were doing this, articles about the Cannes Film Festival were being published every day back home. There were even articles that considered the actors who went to Cannes as \u2018national representatives\u2019.</p><br/><p>City Jungle\u2019s official schedule was picked up by the press too.</p><br/><p>What foreign reporters asked at City Jungle\u2019s press conference. Whether the mood was good or not. What people\u2019s reactions were like in the film market. They even published details about how much it cost for a night in the hotel Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon were staying at and what their amenities were.</p><br/><p>While the interest back home was growing more heated, the gazes we received here in Cannes was still lukewarm. While we continuously received interview requests, the treatment between us and stars from films nominated for the competition or global stars was as different as heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>That gap continued to grow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more good articles about us before the screening, the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was lunch. The now pale and thin project producer, who we met at the City Jungle booth, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cRumors are important around here. Worst scenario, the theater will be empty. If that happens, it\u2019s like we just came for ourselves and left. Right, there is an even worse scenario than that. Last time I came here, the audience left in the middle where swearing, so the actors were bawling their eyes out. Our rating in Cannes was the worst, so the press was abuzz\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I handed him a glass of water and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have two screenings. One with the press. And an official screening.\u201d</p><br/><p>City Jungle\u2019s press conference was 8:30 am tomorrow.</p><br/><p>And its official screening was 11:30 pm tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The press screening was too early, and the screening was too late. It was natural for the project producer to be worried about the mood in the theater tomorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the film is so good, once word gets out after the press screening, the official screening will be smooth sailing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer licked his dry lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible. If our film, City Jungle, is able to come through to this crowd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it good enough to get our hopes up for? Especially considering it was nominated for best rookie director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then, Team Leader Jung, do you also think we have a chance at receiving the award?\u201d</p><br/><p>A chance at receiving the award?</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because we were invited to the Cannes Film Festival after I spoke positively on our chances of getting invited to the staff, but there were a few who seemed to be getting their hopes up on receiving an award. I made the same reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I have my hopes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I wasn\u2019t certain this time as well.</p><br/><p>I had recalled the words \u2018You made a box office hit with your debut movie, a non-mainstream with a noir feel, and won rookie director and screenplay awards. You even attended Cannes.\u2019 From my future vision several times.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t be certain whether they received an award at Cannes or if they received it in Korea then went to Cannes. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, the current City Jungle was different in many parts compared to the version I saw in my vision, so I had no idea how much the present had changed.</p><br/><p>However, despite this, I had high hopes.</p><br/><p>I hoped that the future I change proceeded in a better direction.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>An interview tonight was delayed, so we had a short break.</p><br/><p>Because we had a lot of stuff to prepare for tomorrow, even though I said \u2018break\u2019, it was only for an hour or two. The Boulevard de la Croisette, which was splendid during the day, was heating up with competition screenings and red-carpet events. It was a festival.</p><br/><p>Seeing this made people\u2019s hearts heat up and surge.</p><br/><p>Stylists and artists went over to luxury brand stores in case there were better dresses here, and Lee Kwanwoo rushed over to the beach to chase a romantic mood.</p><br/><p>And I knocked on a hotel door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door immediately opened. Lee Songha said in a resigned voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. We have one or two hours of free time, so I was thinking we could go out together if you weren\u2019t too tired-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired!\u201d</p><br/><p>The door slammed shut.</p><br/><p>Even while she was adjusting to this new environment, she would repeatedly ask me when we would get some free time. I was a little worried when she became dispirited after being rejected eight times. She rushed out, full of energy, thirty minutes later.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is your handbag so stuffed? We only have two hours, so you should leave the guidebook behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry and just believe me! We can spend the two hours like it was twenty!\u201d</p><br/><p>That was worrying.</p><br/><p>Leaving Lee Songha, whose lips were curved so high up I thought they would split, I knocked on the door next to hers.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon opened the door. At the same time, Lee Songha, who looked like she was dying to brag, barely managed to contain herself and say,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be out for a while. We have some important business to attend to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming with us though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo attend some important business with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said this, Lee Songha\u2019s face turned into a murderer\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup pushed Nam Joyoon\u2019s back as he came out of his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dawdle. Let\u2019s go! We don\u2019t have time to waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha kept glancing at me as we made our way down on the elevator.</p><br/><p>Various emotions, such as sadness and disappointment, flashed across her face as she seemed to be inwardly cursing about how terrible the world was and how nothing went her way. She looked like she was about to say something, but all she did was open and close her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not like an opportunity like this comes every day. I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll get an opportunity like this again.\u2019</p><br/><p>I read her lips and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Was this a bad habit?</p><br/><p>By the time we walked out through the hotel entrance, Lee Songha\u2019s face had turned from a murderer\u2019s to a slaughterer\u2019s. It was to the point where the paparazzi and spectators, who came out to see stars going out to enjoy parties, slowly backed away from Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Then when we left the hotel vicinity\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, call me if you run into any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s meet later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup waved their hands as they crossed the street.</p><br/><p>I waved at them as well before continuing to walk down the street. Dazedly following me, Lee Songha\u2019s gaze alternated between me and Nam Joyoon. Then she became excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought we were going out in a group in case we get caught by Korean reporters!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would there be an issue when a manager and his celebrity are going around together in a foreign country?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the best alibi.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo issue. None at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha smiled brightly, revealing her white teeth.</p><br/><p>I took a half-step closer to her and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stick closer together just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cC-can we? How close?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know. They say there are a lot of pickpockets around here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we need to be careful! I saw a warning in the guidebook as well. Let\u2019s stick really close together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s steps became more cheerful.</p><br/><p>I followed her lead.</p><br/><p>Then we entered the streets of the city bustling with nightlife and no one to recognize us.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-216\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 216\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-218\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 218\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201527\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

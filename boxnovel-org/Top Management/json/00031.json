If there are any problems inside, just ask Younghoon hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had a few meetings with the management team 3 leader in the past so I knew him a bit.</p><br/><p>He was a refreshing and funny person.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left Kim Hyunjo and Sung Dowon\u2019s manager behind me and entered the office.</p><br/><p>Like he told me, there were 5 people holding a discussion in the office. CEO Baek Hansung was sitting in the top seat, while Sung Dowon and the bearded management team 2 leader were sitting on the left sofa, and the director and management team 3 leader were on the right.</p><br/><p>Because they had been able to overcome this crisis well, everyone was happy, except for the team 2 leader. He looked at me with unpleasant eyes.</p><br/><p>Just what was wrong with him? I had never seen him before so why did he hate me so much?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, if it isn\u2019t our team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm, come here and sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team 3 leader said jokingly as he tapped the seat next to him. I greeted everyone and went towards him. When I comfortably sat down and looked up, I saw Sung Dowon directly in front of me, smiling softly.</p><br/><p>Wait. This layout seemed somewhat familiar.</p><br/><p>I recalled why in a few seconds.</p><br/><p>Last time I came here, I was too busy and the haziness in the office I remembered was too severe to make out\u2026 but now that I was sitting directly in front of Sung Dowon, I figured it out.</p><br/><p>This was the office I was in the first time I experienced the faulty future.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name is Jung Sunwoo, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung asked me abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear the results of the photo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I heard from Team Leader Park.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard our employees call you team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm. I guess we could call you W&amp;U\u2019s Lucky Charm from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung, who had been complimenting me, suddenly asked me another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a car?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? No, I don\u2019t have one yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou plan to get one though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I planned on buying one. I simply didn\u2019t have the money.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen pick one out. The company will pay for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Excuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Give what to me?</p><br/><p>I looked at him thinking I misheard him, but the director added in while laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you hesitating? You have to quickly accept when he offers you these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was thankful, no, it was so abrupt that I became tongue-tied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what are you going to do if he picks out a something like a Rolls Royce? Kids are scary these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to give him mine and walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Light laughter sounded out at his joke.</p><br/><p>Holding onto the photo with Sung Dowon and the married woman, CEO Baek Hansung quietly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more important than the fact this photo is fabricated, is that Pure Star really did have a hand in this. It\u2019s a relief we knew ahead. How shitty would we feel if we later found out that we had fallen for their tricks?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, it was Pure Star Entertainment.</p><br/><p>So that was why he offered me a car\u2026 No. Let\u2019s think about that seriously when I have more time.</p><br/><p>Then what would happen to Pure Star now?</p><br/><p>Taking photos without permission, fabrication and threats would be enough to file a lawsuit. Recalling what Director Park said in the future, it didn\u2019t seem as though Pure Star Entertainment had continued to be victorious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Pure Star Entertainment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSung Dowon and I are going to meet their CEO tonight. That\u2019s a problem we\u2019ll deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was curious what kind of conversation they would have.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem like they would simply talk to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, that\u2019s my present. Dowon said he also has something to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung fell back and this time Sung Dowon turned his torso towards me. He slightly bowed his head in greeting before looking directly at my eyes and saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Sunwoo, correct? I am really grateful about today\u2019s incident. You are my benefactor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft, that\u2019s too much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader grumbled, but Sung Dowon firmly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is my benefactor. If it wasn\u2019t for Mr. Sunwoo, I would have fallen for their trap and my acting career might have been over. So that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I heard these words I had continuously thought about to the point of memorizing them.</p><br/><p>The faulty future had become my present.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like Sunwoo to be my manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when I was making my way through a torrent of complicated emotions.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader clicked his tongue and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was anyone else, I would have said something about them taking away our good recruit, but I can\u2019t resist our top star.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh well\u2026 Nothing I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader placed his hand on my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you want to work with Dowon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, how frustrating. Do you really need to ask him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader cut in with a snort.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, can we even compare Neptune and Sung Dowon? Even Jang Seomoon was able to become Dowon\u2019s manager by overcoming multiple candidates. He\u2019s offering someone, who hasn\u2019t even worked for a month, a position like that. Who would be crazy enough to refuse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have to say it like that? No one knows what will happen in the future. Who knows whether Neptune will suddenly increase in popularity next year? Neptune\u2019s on a roll.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew something for certain.</p><br/><p>Even though they were both team leaders, they didn\u2019t have a good relationship with each other.</p><br/><p>Although they hadn\u2019t started thrusting their fingers at each other, the situation was growing more heated. But there was no mediator. CEO Baek Hansung and the director, they were elegantly drinking their coffee as if this was usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to wait and see to know if they\u2019re on a roll or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader added flames to the fire by mumbling those words. This time, even I felt angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, what kind of dogshit manner is this? Why are you pouring cold water on someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the one with dogshit manners? The guy next to you poured cold water on our Chaeyoung\u2019s next project. Chaeyoung is a sensitive girl, but after meeting him, she became even more emotional.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s name was mentioned out of the blue.</p><br/><p>I was wondering why this team 2 leader I had never seen hated me, and now I knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky things went well this time, but I have never seen anyone, who is as meddlesome as him, not mess up. It\u2019s already uneasy leaving him next to Dowon\u2026 I\u2019m only letting it pass because we need to find a new manager once Jang Seomoon leaves anyways, and since Dowon likes him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is why your nickname is Mother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched while listening to their conversation.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Jang Seomoon was Sung dowon\u2019s manager, who was outside. If they said they were going to push him out and place me in his position, didn\u2019t that mean they were going to fire him? Because of this incident?</p><br/><p>To be honest, I thought that this was more of Sung Dowon\u2019s fault than the manager\u2019s\u2026 Since it was Sung Dowon who lied and left the manager behind. But the one who was blamed and chased out was the manager.</p><br/><p>Of course, I knew that the relationship between a manager and a celebrity wasn\u2019t as close and familial like in the dramas. Since they were in a relationship tied by business.</p><br/><p>I was well aware that there were many cases where a celebrity would abuse their manager and that the opposite was true as well. I knew that, in the worst cases, they would even end up going to court.</p><br/><p>Though I was well aware of it\u2026 This situation felt a little bitter to me.</p><br/><p>Since I felt that I could one day end up like Jang Seomoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s hear what the person in question has to say. He\u2019s unable to speak because you two team leaders are bickering.\u201d</p><br/><p>The CEO calmed the situation.</p><br/><p>The office quickly became silent. However, I wasn\u2019t able to speak easily. If I accepted, that meant I would be Sung Dowon\u2019s only manager, and if that was the case, it would be impossible to be the manager of both Sung Dowon and Neptune.</p><br/><p>I turned my head to tell the team 3 leader about my worries, but just then, as if he had read my mind, he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is it because of Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It is an important time for them\u2026 Would it be possible to be assigned to both Neptune and Sung Dowon?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader showed a complicated expression as he scratched his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you have a sense of responsibility, but that\u2019s a bit difficult. Dowon has a lot of overseas schedules. He goes to China as if he\u2019s going to lunch and we are planning on going to Hollywood next year. Since he\u2019ll be new there, you\u2019ll have to be next to him on set. You won\u2019t be able to manage Neptune\u2019s schedule with all that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe if you had the experience of a chief, but you\u2019re currently still learning. This isn\u2019t good for you nor is it good for Neptune and Sung Dowon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader suddenly cut into our conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune has another new recruit anyways. You can come after letting him take over. I heard that you wanted to be assigned to an actor. Dowon is the top within our company. You can\u2019t even tell when you\u2019ve hit jackpot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If I looked at it rationally, the team 2 leader\u2019s words were right.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a choice I needed to think about.</p><br/><p>A top actor who possessed outstanding acting skills and box office performance. Being assigned to an actor like Sung Dowon was something I anticipated and wished for the most when entering W&amp;U. And I had already decided that if I was to change the present, I would choose the better future.</p><br/><p>Neptune was a group who had potential but was only starting to get traction now.</p><br/><p>Sung Dowon was someone who was considered top in the nation and was preparing to go overseas.</p><br/><p>If I asked 10 people, 9 would instantly choose Sung Dowon. And the remaining one would be called crazy.</p><br/><p>Excluding the things that were preventing me from making a decision\u2026 When I thought about the connections and experience I would gain overseas, especially in Hollywood, the moment I accepted his offer and how beneficial it would be to my future. This wasn\u2019t a decision worth troubling over.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 why wasn\u2019t I able reply right away?</p><br/><p>It felt as if something was clinging to my ankle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director laughed as if this was amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never knew you would have so much trouble deciding between Dowon and Neptune. It seemed you\u2019ve gotten quite close to Neptune in such a short time. Should we give you more time to think about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, I\u2019m at a loss for words.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader hit the table and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat more do you need to think about? No, we won\u2019t force anyone who doesn\u2019t want to. Do you know how many people would quit their jobs to be Dowon\u2019s manager? There\u2019s no need for more time, decide here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of Neptune, especially Lee Songha who had only today told me her true thoughts, passed by in front of Sung Dowon\u2019s face which was looking at me.</p><br/><p>Then that moment.</p><br/><p>The world flipped over, and the scene in front of me changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 It\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park clicked her tongue and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough the relationship between Sung Dowon and Pure Star was originally bad since they both had dirt on each other, they shouldn\u2019t have crossed a certain line\u2026 But once Pure Star\u2019s tricks came to light, they had passed a point of no return. That slowly started to worsen until it eventually exploded.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did Director Park say just now?</p><br/><p>Sung Dowon and Pure Star passed a point of no return? It eventually exploded?</p><br/><p>I tried to concentrate harder than ever to decipher Director Park\u2019s words, but then she dropped a bomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cSung Dowon and Pure Star started to expose each other and had press conferences which eventually led to both a criminal and civil suit in court.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey exposed each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPure Star did a lot of dirty things, but it turned out, they were both peas in a pod.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh my god.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-30\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 30\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-32\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 32\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201174\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

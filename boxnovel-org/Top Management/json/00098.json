When I opened the door, it was like a completely new world.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so big! It\u2019s bigger than my room!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this really our waiting room? Did they put the wrong name on the door?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung chattered, saying how they could practice their choreography here to their hearts\u2019 content, while Lee Taehee and Lee Songha looked satisfied as they sat down on the plush sofa. Without doubtful eyes, LJ went out to check if this really was our waiting room and returned.</p><br/><p>Compared to the chicken coop we used last year, this was a 5-star hotel. Even the waiting room we used during their comeback was only half the size of this room.</p><br/><p>I always felt this, but in this damn entertainment industry, popularity was everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, are we really using this room all on our own? Has our level really increased this much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, while that might be part of it, it\u2019s also probably because you girls are first place candidates today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, the mood in the waiting room became strange. Im Seoyoung, who was reading everyone\u2019s mood, fiddled with her flare skirt as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I really came here with no expectations. After being nervous that we might be disbanded during the two years we\u2019ve debuted, just being one of the first place candidates already feels like I\u2019ve been hit with luck! We even placed first on the music charts! My heart is peace itself right now, oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, you seemed very agitated right now.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, who had been chatting on her own without being asked, suddenly turned her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaehee unni, you don\u2019t expect to place first too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee replied with half-closed eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha, you don\u2019t expect to place first either, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who had been rummaging through the snack basket, nodded her head. I occasionally thought this, but, overall, the members of this team were calm and composed, yet it felt balanced since Im Seoyoung made enough fuss for four people.</p><br/><p>Lastly, Im Seoyoung stared at LJ, who was sitting on the chair in front of the dressing table and shaking her crossed leg. Before Im Seoyoung could open her mouth, LJ said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only one who\u2019s holding expectations here is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! I heard you calling your parents and relatives to vote by text last night. You were even memorizing your speech if we place first. I could hear it all because the walls are thin, dummy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung\u2019s cheeks instantly reddened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! If we really do place first, I won\u2019t be able to think of anything! It\u2019s a live broadcast! If you don\u2019t want to look foolish, you have to memorize everything you want to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, you are hoping for first.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. Im Seoyoung, who opened and closed her mouth while flushed with anger, slumped down below the sofa and clung to my leg with an expression of holding onto a lifeline.</p><br/><p>It seemed her emotional anxiety had flared up. She did endure for a long while.</p><br/><p>\u201cEuaaah, oppa, what do I do? I, I really tried not to be so hopeful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know that we have no hope with the text voting since it\u2019s a fight between fandoms, and I also know that if I get my hopes up for the hopeless, I\u2019ll be even more disappointed. But I keep thinking of the first place trophy! To be honest, last night, I dreamed of decorating our living room with the trophy!\u201d</p><br/><p>She buried her face in her hands and slammed her head against the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf oppa wasn\u2019t next to me, I might have already lost it by now!\u201d</p><br/><p>More than now?</p><br/><p>Worried that she might call herself a \u2018stupid dummy\u2019 again, I patted her round shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with getting your hopes up? I\u2019m hopeful too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You are, oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to pressure you, I\u2019m saying it because there is a small possibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly added in case they felt more pressure from reading my mood like they did during the music chart ranking incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also told my brother and sister-in-law to vote. I even thought about buying the quadruplets phones so that we could get four more votes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you get your hopes up and we don\u2019t place first, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have a drink tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said nonchalantly. Im Seoyoung, who had been slumped over like a half-melted jelly, returned to her original state. Im Seoyoung crawled over to the seat next to the sofa when Lee Songha added as though it was no big deal,</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m also a bit hopeful. You never know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung quickly turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? When your face seems like it\u2019ll be fine if we don\u2019t place first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy face is always like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. So you got your hopes up too. It wasn\u2019t just me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She blinked while glancing at Lee Taehee. Lee Taehee, who had been leaning back and massaging her long neck, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too\u2026 A little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s a song I created, it\u2019s a lie if I say I had no expectations. If we drop from the first place candidates, then I\u2019ll have a bottle of alcohol too.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Lee Taehee subtly smiled in my direction. I clearly said one drink.</p><br/><p>Now that she had heard the other girls\u2019 inner thoughts, Im Seoyoung recovered her calm. While smiling, she looked at LJ. With her legs still crossed, LJ said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you also have your hope-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thought so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung grumbled with narrowed eyes. LJ looked back at us with her arms crossed and clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? I\u2019m the only one in this room who hasn\u2019t gotten ahead of herself? The mood tonight will be fantastic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on being one of the first place candidates! Isn\u2019t this your first time in three years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly great talents mature late. Congrats, Neptune!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Mr. Manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>People kept congratulating us in every waiting room we went to greet.</p><br/><p>Singers and cast members no longer treated Neptune as old rookies, and entertainment reporters asked us questions regarding the Sugar Cats like hyenas targeting their prey.</p><br/><p>If I let the girls answer every question, then their names would be plastered on the entertainment columns in a few hours with the added bonus of provocative headlines to increase their site traffic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the girls are too nervous today from being one of the first place candidates, I don\u2019t think they will be able to hold any interviews. Let us do it next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said this while guiding the girls back, a reporter now asked me for comments. It seemed I also looked like a celebrity to reporters who were thirsty for anything newsworthy.</p><br/><p>We were on our way back to the waiting room after getting away from the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Neptune! And their manager. Do you have a bit of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>A producer with a headset on his head waded through the crowd and approached us.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two first place candidates will be having a back-and-forth in the MC seats. I think we\u2019ll have to rehearse it because it\u2019s live and not a recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I wasn\u2019t fine seeing the faces of the Sugar Cats.</p><br/><p>\u201cSugar-BYG team has more members so we\u2019ll go to their waiting room.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer smiled gently while guiding us there.</p><br/><p>When we opened the door with \u2018Sugar Cats\u2019 and \u2018BYG\u2019 written on it together, we entered a waiting room that was twice the size of our own waiting room.</p><br/><p>We also saw the Sugar Cats members, who sitting in front of the dressing tables and looking at their phones.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, where are the BYG members?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the producer asked while looking around, the chief of the Sugar Cats scratched the back of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, producer. They said that they were going to have an interview with a reporter for a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you that I\u2019ll be bringing Neptune and to wait\u2026 Where did they go?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Sugar Cats\u2019 chief and the producer went out to look for them, only the Sugar Cats and us remaining in this large room. Out of habit, I checked for any cameras. Fortunately, there were none.</p><br/><p>Since we weren\u2019t in a relationship where we would greet each other when nobody was around, I sat on the empty sofa with the girls. As though she had some sort of terminal illness if she didn\u2019t lash out at Neptune, no, Im Seoyoung, Han Saetbyeol snorted as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung, I can\u2019t tell if you have good or bad luck, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? I think this is the luckiest I\u2019ve been in the 22 years I\u2019ve lived, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>What was interesting was that her atmosphere was quite different in front of the Sugar Cats. If she was like a fragile bowl in front of us, she was currently a strong stone pot.</p><br/><p>Han Saetbyeol blinked as she continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, what I mean is, you were really lucky to reach first place on the music charts, but you just had to have us as your competitor so you won\u2019t get first place on the music broadcast. So I can\u2019t tell whether you have good or bad-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if your tongue is short, you need to speak properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leisurely leaning against the sofa, LJ joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I not tell you last time? Our competitor is BYG. Even on your door, BYG\u2019s name was above yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they are our seniors! But why do you constantly cut into our conversation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that was conversing? I thought you were just speaking nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, LJ glanced between Im Seoyoung and me before adding,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no people or cameras here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded my head while opening a chocolate Lee Songha handed me.</p><br/><p>If a uselessly famous manager said something, it could become an issue, but I wasn\u2019t worried about words exchanged between girl group members leaking out.</p><br/><p>LJ looked at each of the Sugar Cats members and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me use this opportunity to ask you something. Why do you hate her so much? I\u2019ve been with her for more than three years, but she\u2019s not the type to receive such resentment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, even Im Seoyoung looked like she was slightly interested.</p><br/><p>Breaking the silence, a member of the Sugar Cats with a provocative expression said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way she acts is a bit, you know. So full of herself, doesn\u2019t pay attention to the mood. While we were nervous because our debut kept falling through, she alone was easygoing, as though she was confident in debuting at any time because she was different from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words weren\u2019t simply thorny, her tongue was like a sword. I was about to stop this conversation because I didn\u2019t think this would end in a simple exchange of words, but Im Seoyoung shook her head. Then she asked the Sugar Cats members,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen was I like that? Since everyone was so anxious, I thought that I at least shou-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s being full of yourself. You\u2019ve always looked down at us because you were the center and better at singing and dancing than us. Ah, but now that I think about it, you\u2019re sort of in the same situation now? They say what comes around, goes around.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats member glanced at the girls as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, the visual center is someone else, they have a lead vocalist who can write and compose her own songs, and a, well, slightly talented rapper. They are all members that are talented enough to succeed on their own, but, since you\u2019re in the middle, besides dancing, you don\u2019t have any-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to hear from them, Seoyoung. It\u2019ll only tire our ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and got up since Im Seoyoung\u2019s face became stiff. The Sugar Cats members, who had been chatting, flinched in surprise and shrunk away with expressions asking what I was going to do. While I had thought that they were hateful all this time, I really wanted to pour filthy water on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all so interested in others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We were only saying that because we were worried for Seoyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. We are already looking after her here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee, who had been silent, said while frowning.</p><br/><p>Then she clicked her tongue and patted Im Seoyoung\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have had it tough while you were on that team.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sincerely agreed with her. If I were amidst those girls, my heart might have become rotten and collapsed. It was so fortunate that Im Seoyoung didn\u2019t debut with them and became a member of Neptune.</p><br/><p>Next to me, Lee Songha also added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it were me, I might have thrown something at them.\u201d</p><br/><p>With their eyes narrowed, the Sugar Cats members were about to speak noisily again when LJ kicked the table leg and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk a lot about how you were jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? No, that\u2019s not it. She-!\u201d</p><br/><p>After shooting a glance at Im Seoyoung, Han Saetbyeol looked back at LJ and shot back,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut people might think you\u2019re very close with Im Seoyoung, huh? Don\u2019t you understand what we\u2019re saying? You also don\u2019t like her much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ, who had been composed, widened her eyes at her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s noticeable, you know? I can tell you don\u2019t like her at a glance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hearing all sorts of nonsense today. Why don\u2019t you just screw on a new pair of eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, it seemed the BYG members arrived as a loud, muffled commotion could be heard from outside the door. Before people could enter the waiting room, Han Saetbyeol changed into a smiling expression and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cEither way, since we are going to be first today, why don\u2019t you target IBC\u2019s music broadcast that doesn\u2019t have text voting? Oh, right. Don\u2019t they hold a vote beforehand? If you want to place first, it\u2019ll be better if you wait until we end our performances on music broadcasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ear-shattering screams erupted from the audience.</p><br/><p>Neptune, the Sugar Cats, and BYG members were standing between the two MCs in the MC seating area to the left of the stage as they greeted the audience and said their predetermined speech. Damn, I couldn\u2019t even hear the girls\u2019 voices because the BYG fans\u2019 screams were too loud.</p><br/><p>I approached the Neptune fans gathered at the edge of the fan seating area below the stage. While, in terms of scale, they were smaller than other boy group fans, they were still fans who had come all this way to support Neptune.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager! Did you vote?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fans who discovered me murmured in surprise. I nodded at the words of the few whom I was quite familiar with.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I did. How about you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already did it before. Since it\u2019s their first time being a first place candidate, we are doing all that we can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are encouraging others to vote on fan sites and the review sections on music chart sites! Just! Why! Don\u2019t male fans understand the importance of text voting?! Whether they become first or not hands on that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman who I had seen so often that I even remembered the nickname she used, \u2018Songha-Eating\u2019, shouted while stomping her feet. Anyways, I gave her a thumbs-up for doing well.</p><br/><p>My phone, which was in my pocket, rang. When I took it out, I was constantly getting text messages. They were messages from company employees, including Kim Hyunjo and the PR Team, saying that they all voted. Even though they said they didn\u2019t get their hopes up, it seemed they were all watching the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>After a short remark from the MC seating area, Neptune\u2019s performance began.</p><br/><p>Because of the incident before, everyone\u2019s mood was serious, but it seemed they poured all their energy into their performance. They were especially passionate today. It wasn\u2019t just the fans in Neptune\u2019s fan seating area, other spectators cheered while waving their cheering items.</p><br/><p>By the time they came down from the stage, the girls all looked slightly refreshed.</p><br/><p>After peacefully waiting in our waiting for about twenty minutes, we returned to the stage while awaiting the first place announcement.</p><br/><p>The Sugar Cats and BYG were already on stage next to the MCs. Other solo artists and idol groups that performed today gathered behind them.</p><br/><p>Before they got up on stage, Lee Songha said in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish we were first today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee nodded her head. In a quiet voice, so others couldn\u2019t hear, I said that, since the Sugar Cats would probably be sick in bed if we became first, we should give them our kind regards through a video call.</p><br/><p>Lastly, LJ, who said that she didn\u2019t hold any expectations, said passingly,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re first, then I\u2019m going to tap dance with the trophy in my hand in front of those jerks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls went up on stage.</p><br/><p>I stood amongst other related people and staff members and looked at the stage being shined on by the lights. A jib camera that was set up very high circled above the girls\u2019 heads. A closeup of the girls appeared on the LED screen behind the stage.</p><br/><p>It seemed they were low on time as the MC began reading his cue card without delay.</p><br/><p>{Only the announcement for the first place on the live broadcast Kpop concert chart remains! Neptune and the Sugar Cats, please present the points to determine which team will return with the glory of being first place!}</p><br/><p>The LED screen displaying the various singers changed into a computer graphic tallying up the points.</p><br/><p>It displayed rows for digital sales, album, broadcast, and live broadcast text voting points as well as the totals, displayed largely on the bottom row. Amidst the echoing cheers in the open hall, the row of points appeared one after another.</p><br/><p>I had planned to quickly add it up in my head, but I couldn\u2019t. The four-digit numbers scattered and wandered in my mind. In the end, I gave up and stared at the computer graphic.</p><br/><p>A few suffocating seconds later, the moment the final totals were displayed, the girls turned to look at me with widened eyes.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-97\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 97\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-99\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 99\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201309\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

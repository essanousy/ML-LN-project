If I talk to Kim Hyunjo tomorrow. Hmm. I guess I\u2019d get the same look I\u2019ve received a few times.</p><br/><p>The \u2018he\u2019s crazy\u2019 look.</p><br/><p>I relaxed and calmed myself down with my mother\u2019s ginger honey tea before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what you said last time. If Cat Guardian Ghost is a success, to tell you then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah.</p><br/><p>A low laugh.</p><br/><p>Was it because he was the CEO? Why couldn\u2019t I even listen to his laughter comfortably?</p><br/><p>-It looks like you found something you wanted?</p><br/><p>As carefully as possible, I talked about Son Chaeyoung, Teacher Shim Kyungtaek, and Lee Songha. It seemed he had already heard this from the team 3 leader as he also seemed to know the whole story.</p><br/><p>While I was seriously setting things up for my final words, CEO Baek Hansung indicated he was listening with short replies.</p><br/><p>After I expressed everything I could, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than a spoken apology\u2026 I\u2019d like if she paid the appropriate price.\u201d</p><br/><p>-How odd.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice from the other end continued.</p><br/><p>-When I listen to you talk, it feels like you are certain the drama will do well.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s because it\u2019s a good drama. I believe that it will definitely be a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good. That seemed natural.</p><br/><p>-Okay. Then try making it a success. I\u2019ll think about the price.</p><br/><p>I clenched my fist.</p><br/><p>Teacher Shim Kyungtaek\u2019s overbearing face and Son Chaeyoung\u2019s mocking face appeared in front of me. I thought I\u2019d have trouble sleeping after seeing those two poor excuses for human beings today, but my mind became calm at last.</p><br/><p>Then I suddenly recalled CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s motive for calling me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you wanted to ask me was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what did he have to ask me?</p><br/><p>While spinning my head and thinking of different circumstances, I heard a relaxed voice.</p><br/><p>-That drama. How do you think it\u2019ll do in China?</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m asking a lucky person to guess.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Beijing, China.</p><br/><p>In the living room of the glamorous suite room lavished in red, CEO Baek Hansung, who was leaning against a spacious sofa, said a few more words before hanging up. He tossed his phone to the side of the sofa and threw his head back.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, we need to go down in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director entered the living room and sat on the sofa. His exhaustion due to the busy schedule was clearly evident on his face. Although they were on the same schedule, he looked twice as exhausted as CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut who did you call for so long? Was it the team 3 leader again?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung, who was lost in thought with his eyes closed, curled his lips into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Jung Sunwoo\u2026 Jung Sun- The team 3 Luck Tosser?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the director became puzzled, CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s smile grew even more apparent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was something I wanted to ask him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what did you have to ask him\u2026 Ah, the problem regarding Chaeyoung and Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that too. I asked him to guess what the reaction of Cat Guardian Ghost would be in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taken aback, the director said exasperatingly,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s not some sort of shaman. At this rate, we might have to pay him a commission.\u201d</p><br/><p>While sitting on the sofa and looking through the thick folder he had brought, the director asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what did he say.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung paused for a moment. As if out of habit, his white, long finger tapped on the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he thinks it\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I wish it does. But, while it\u2019s true that his ability is extraordinary at times, I don\u2019t know about his senses. The reason why he rejected Dowon when he asked him to be his manager, it seemed that he later said he got a bad vibe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>His finger stopped in midair.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung straightened his relaxed posture. He brushed back his tangled hair and narrowed his eyes. His eyes shined as if he found a good source of entertainment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he got a bad vibe from Sung Dowon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it was probably a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite odd\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the director said to the quietly mumbling CEO,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s one more. I heard this from the PR team. Well, they told me this was also said as a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMermaid out of Water, he said he got a bad vibe about that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, CEO Baek Hansung tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s unexpected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure about his senses. It might just be his habit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, did Luck Tosser say anything about the problem regarding Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. We decided to talk about it again in January.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJanuary? Why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two dramas start broadcasting that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s tone was mixed with interest and an odd feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The director cut his words short when he saw the CEO lost in thought.</p><br/><p>After around 10 minutes had passed, CEO Baek Hansung stretched as his muscles inside his thin shirt showed their vigor. After ridding himself of exhaustion, he stretched out his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe portfolios?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I did prepare them as you told me to.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director took out a few portfolios from the folder he was holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone else\u2019s image isn\u2019t really good enough to replace Dowon\u2026 The advertisers want a high-class, refined image. Jijoon is the closest to what they are looking for, but he\u2019s not well-known in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung received the portfolios and wordlessly flipped through them. The director scratched his half-balding head and asked in a quiet voice, even though they were the only two there,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Why are you trying to replace Dowon? The advertisers chose Dowon, and since they\u2019ve clearly experienced the effects of marketing with a star, they will try not to let him go.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung stared at Sung Dowon\u2019s portfolio in his hand. Sung Dowon\u2019s profile picture was of him, barefooted in a white dress shirt, lying down on a sandy beach with a smile. It was the cool, elegant smile that made him a popular Hallyu<sup>{1}</sup> star.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to clean up the uncontrollable bomb.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung closed the portfolio and tossed it below the sofa.</p><br/><p>Looking at this, the director subtly licked his lips and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Chaeyoung? Apparently, the advertisers had wanted to keep Dowon and replace Chaeyoung with a new face, but they stopped once Mermaid out of Water received heated reactions in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Korea is in a frenzy about Cat Guardian Ghost, the reactions for Mermaid out of Water is pretty good here. Well, since it\u2019s to the point where the copyrights for this unreleased drama sold for $1.7 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>After rubbing his chin multiple times, CEO Baek Hansung placed Seo Jijoon\u2019s portfolio on the table. Then pushed Son Chaeyoung\u2019s portfolio, which was next to it, aside and replaced it with a thin, paltry portfolio.</p><br/><p>It was Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does this look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, umm\u2026 They look good. They look good, but I don\u2019t think the advertisers will like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director, who had replied hesitantly, scratched the hair behind his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot many people know Jijoon here, but Songha is completely unknown. Maybe if, like Luck Tosser said, the drama is a big hit in China, but that\u2019s something decided by heavens. Would it really be that lucky?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to see. Did you say that contracts of the Cat Guardian Ghost copyrights are still ongoing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Pan Production is trying their best, but it seems the contract needs more adjustments. It looks like they are in a bit of a mess because it hasn\u2019t been long since the production itself was founded, and above all, they don\u2019t have a Hallyu star to push. Maybe I should have talked to Blackout since playing around after their concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director mumbled while licking his lips.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung checked his watch and leisurely wore his necktie.</p><br/><p>Soon, he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind out the CEO of Pan Production\u2019s number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, tell him to get meetings with a few big online video platforms here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director let out a silent sigh as he expected that, listening to the CEO\u2019s words, they would have to push back their return date. Unlike the director\u2019s round, slumped shoulders, CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s lips curved upwards as he gazed at the three portfolios on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m curious about this as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much of Jung Sunwoo\u2019s vibes are correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>It felt like I was speeding on the Autobahn in a sports car.</p><br/><p>Each day passed by at lightning speed. Although I had never gone to the autobahn or ridden in a sports car, I just thought it would feel like this.</p><br/><p>Extremely fast.</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, we had another filming of Next K-Star and two more episodes of it had been broadcast. The highest viewership rating was 3.1% on the first broadcast, 3.6% on the second, and 3.9% on the third. It kept reaching a new highest viewership rating every broadcast and continued to go up.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because we were close to hitting 4%, but the staff\u2019s smiles were reaching their ears.</p><br/><p>Although Producer Go Joontae still put Neptune, especially focusing on Lee Songha, through various edits and milked Lee Songha\u2019s trendiness, he didn\u2019t directly screw them over again like the first broadcast. Of course, since we didn\u2019t know when he would screw us over again, we had to keep our eyes open.</p><br/><p>Either way, since their faces kept showing up on screen, they were becoming more and more well-known, and since they continuously received good scores from the judges, they were gradually building the image of a talented girl group.</p><br/><p>Broadcasts were indeed great as, once their name became a little known, they started to receive more event requests and increased pay, and they now made enough to at least pay their makeup expenses. This was worth clapping for.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Accompanied by the cold night air, the traitor entered the open hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you smoke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it smell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it does. You didn\u2019t smoke before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI quit\u2026 But I started craving it recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor clicked his tongue as he shook his clothes. Maybe it was because of the cigarette, but his face, which looked as exhausted as Kim Hyunjo\u2019s, seemed to have found some of its vigor.</p><br/><p>Due to my family environment, I never touched a cigarette during school or even mandatory military service, but I\u2019ve become tempted recently. Other team managers would look livelier after a smoke during filming as if they had an IV injection.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s Songha\u2019s first drama filming, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Finally.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing the photo shoot for the poster and Gosa<sup>{2}</sup>, Cat Guardian Ghost began filming not too long ago. They were busy filming the flashback scenes of the male and female leads before snow started to fall. Although it was Songha\u2019s first filming today, I heard that Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon were already spending their days going back and forth between the outdoor and indoor film sets.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to the set right after this recording?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They said we need to be on standby by 4 a.m.\u201d</p><br/><p>It currently just past midnight right now. We needed to dash to the film set after erasing her performance makeup, putting on new makeup, and changing her outfit. While I was looking at my watch and estimating the time, the traitor let out a small sigh and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you probably won\u2019t be able to come to work tomorrow. I\u2019ll text you the details of the meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting meetings discussing the girls\u2019 next mini album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, right. We were.</p><br/><p>There were countless celebrities who faded into obscurity after the programs, that made them well-known, ended. To prevent this from happening to Neptune, we were carefully considering our next step.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was Neptune\u2019s next mini album, which would be released early next year.</p><br/><p>This was because, while we are focusing on entertainment shows and dramas, Neptune was a girl group. If they even had one hit song the general public knew the melody of, their activities could greatly expand to performances, events, autograph events, as well as others.</p><br/><p>Because their future would be well set if this album was a success, all related employees were mobilized and were putting their heart and soul into it. Since there weren\u2019t only one or two albums with Neptune\u2019s name on it that failed, it felt like they were all grounding their teeth in determination.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo had pretty much become a roaming zombie, yet full of drive, trying to prevent Neptune from quickly falling from the music charts this time.</p><br/><p>The only person who felt more expectant than pressured or worried was probably me.</p><br/><p>Since I knew that there was a very likely chance that Neptune\u2019s next title track would reach first on the music charts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Lee Songha. Good luck with filming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Im Seoyoung as she rubbed her tired eyes in front of their residence. Lee Taehee and LJ held their yawns back as they added their own words of encouragement.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, good luck. Don\u2019t be pressured since it\u2019s your first filming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo they give you breakfast there? I set aside some snacks in the back seat so if you\u2019re hungry, of course, you will be, you can eat it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was the only one left in the van as she nodded her head in front of the window. Of course, she showed the greatest reaction to LJ\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>I was about to start the van when Im Seoyoung said some gloomy words from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to do better than Son Chaeyoung! Son Chae-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give her pressure, dummy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The back mirror reflected Im Seoyoung getting hit in the back of her head by LJ.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and I tidied up Son Chaeyoung and Teacher Shim Kyungtaek\u2019s atrocities before telling the girls, but wow, their reactions were killer. Either way, Son Chaeyoung became their mutual enemy at their residence.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee was silently angry, while LJ threw an uppercut to Im Seoyoung\u2019s cat doll and ripped its leg. Im Seoyoung printed out a humiliating photo of Son Chaeyoung, placed in an easily viewable spot in the living room, and made time to appreciate it every day.</p><br/><p>I heard that the company would have a New Year\u2019s party at the beginning of the year. I couldn\u2019t imagine what would happen when they met Son Chaeyoung there.</p><br/><p>Well, since we weren\u2019t sure, I jokingly talked with Kim Hyunjo about it.</p><br/><p>Asking whether we should prepare a few cakes at our table.</p><br/><p>We visited the shop, finished our preparations for the shoot, and immediately drove to the outdoor film site next to Han River. Lee Songha, who was sitting in the back seat, was eating the snacks prepared by LJ as if they were military provisions as she flipped through her script.</p><br/><p>Looking at her expression, it seemed she had partially gotten into the role of Jung Haewon already.</p><br/><p>I shouldn\u2019t bother her.</p><br/><p>Although it was very late, there were almost a hundred people crowding the filming set on Han riverbank. I slowly approached before opening the van window and sticking my head out. I was faced with the wet, howling wind along with the loud noises on set.</p><br/><p>There was a long crane, lighting equipment, cameras, thick cables, and people going around holding reflectors. I was seeing the busy filming site I had only seen in behind-the-scenes videos with my own two eyes.</p><br/><p>I felt adrenaline surging within me. I probably had the same face the quadruplets would have when they arrived at an amusement park.</p><br/><p>When I parked the van between other vans, a familiar assistant director knocked on the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re working hard when it\u2019s so late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is nothing since we\u2019re only starting. Nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director gestured to the film site with his chin and said worriedly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe staff who didn\u2019t get to see the script reading session as well as extras. They are all talking a ton about Lee Songha. Since this is Han River, there will be a big crowd of people when the day brightens\u2026 The director was worried Lee Songha would feel pressured. Will she be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned to my back.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was staring at the cover of the script. No. I couldn\u2019t really tell whether she was looking at the cover or if the cover just happened to be where she was staring at. Beside her were leftover snacks she hadn\u2019t finished yet.</p><br/><p>I nodded my head to the assistant director.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director shouted into the intercom on the headset around his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he briefly placed his ear next to the headset before looking in my direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Lee Songha will do a rehearsal first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then said his final words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen immediately begin filming!\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Hallyu \u2013 a term to indicate Korean entertainment and music spreading overseas.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> A ritual to avoid misfortune and bring good luck.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-57\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 57\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-59\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 59\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201229\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

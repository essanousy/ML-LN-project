I could have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can date on top of your current schedule, then you\u2019re my senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kim Hyunjo said while chuckling, team leader 3 joined in. They talked about how long it had been since they dated and that this would be my future. They were pouring cold water on my bright future.</p><br/><p>Just what were they doing after calling me over when I was busy?</p><br/><p>When I gave them a nasty look, Kim Hyunjo grinned whilst supporting his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking since you seem so serious considering that you should be grinning all over the place. We finished Next K-Star without any problem and Cat Guardian Ghost, after being heralded as a historical drama, is creating a second wave in China. Everything\u2019s proceeding smoothly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. At every team leader meeting, I was bashed that we were pouring the money Blackout was making into Neptune and team leader 2, that bastard, never forgot to add his own remarks, but now I can walk in with my back straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right. It was currently the best time since I was assigned to Neptune.</p><br/><p>The final recording of Next K-Star ended well despite our worries, and Cat Guardian Ghost ended after receiving high praise yesterday.</p><br/><p>Since the highly anticipated dramas, like Mermaid out of Water and Time Slip, flopped badly, we gained their audience as well, resulting in a syndrome.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t spring yet, but reporters were picking Cat Guardian Ghost as the drama of the year and the audience were petitioning for a director\u2019s cut, saying that they would even empty their bank accounts for it.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s image couldn\u2019t get better.</p><br/><p>If the drama was on a public network than cable, then no one would argue with the opinion that Seo Jijoon should receive the acting award and the Rookie of the Year award should belong to Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>This was why it wasn\u2019t strange for Kim Hyunjo\u2019s dark circles to fade noticeably and obvious that the team 3 leader would go around with a happy face.</p><br/><p>I would have been the same.</p><br/><p>Only if I hadn\u2019t seen that future that could give thrillers a run for their money.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else on my mind. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I just glossed over it, Kim Hyunjo said as if he understood,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of Son Chaeyoung and Teacher Shim Kyungtaek?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader crossed his legs and clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm, sometimes, it looks like you worry too much. You shouldn\u2019t worry about them. It\u2019s like a hundred-year poo finally being dislodged. If we were to really expose Teacher Shim Kyungtaek, he\u2019s someone whose secrets would pour down like hail so he won\u2019t try to bite us back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI even heard he\u2019s resigning from the university he\u2019s been teaching at? Something about rumors spreading amongst his students?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince rumors have spread far and wide, all the private lessons with rookies should have been canceled as well. To be honest, if he hadn\u2019t used Son Chaeyoung\u2019s name, he wouldn\u2019t even be close to the number of private lessons he gave. But that\u2019s over now that his relationship with Son Chaeyoung has gone sour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why they say you have one shot in life. How will he live now, that guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis career in this industry is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader and Kim Hyunjo\u2019s smiles revealed how refreshed they were.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an appetizer, I have more refreshing news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo smiled meaningfully before grabbing an envelope from the side. The envelope was so thick it looked like it might explode.</p><br/><p>After taking the envelope out, Kim Hyunjo pushed it towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, a commercial for a jeans company. It\u2019s for Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung used to do that commercial, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader added.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo took out a much thicker envelope this time. It was a scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Director Chae Munho\u2019s new movie. He said he wanted to audition Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was a project originally for Son Chaeyoung as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>A commercial proposal, movie scenario, and drama synopsis came out after that. Although they were diverse, they all had one thing in common.</p><br/><p>They were all projects Son Chaeyoung used to do or ones they were discussing with Son Chaeyoung to do.</p><br/><p>I pushed my thoughts about landmines and bombs into a corner of my mind. I looked enchanted at the envelopes in front of me. Oh my god. To those who didn\u2019t know, this sight would only look like a bunch of paper, but to me, they were a more shocking sight than diamonds.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader scratched his nose and smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know by looking too, but they are a difference of heaven and earth in terms of roles and investment scale compared to the ones Lee Songha received. Of course, we will have to have internal meetings about movies and dramas and she would have to audition for them, but these are opportunities that don\u2019t come to people at Songha\u2019s level.\u201d</p><br/><p>I did receive scenarios and synopses from a few directors, but none of the roles were as important as these. These were roles given to actors whose talent had been verified through multiple projects.</p><br/><p>Actors like Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of these went to Lee Songha? Is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNormally, it would be impossible. Even though Mermaid out of Water flopped majestically, someone at Son Chaeyoung\u2019s level wouldn\u2019t lose so many commercial and project offers because one drama flopped. However, for so many and for all of them to go to Songha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe CEO probably had a hand in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader and Kim Hyunjo answered in turn.</p><br/><p>Then the team 3 leader gave me a strange look.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what the director said, apparently, you\u2019re the one who got these?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I got them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if he was joking or not, but that\u2019s apparently what the CEO said. That Jung Sunwoo obtained them.\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly recalled the phone call I had with CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>When I asked that Son Chaeyoung pay a proper price instead of a simple apology, CEO Baek Hansung had said that he would think about the price.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said while grinning,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is probably the worst nightmare for Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since an ending party was a place where people expressed their inner thoughts after the drama ended, the mood of the ending party changed depending on the success of the drama. In the case of Mermaid out of Water, there was an article that they didn\u2019t even hold an ending party.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s ending party was wild.</p><br/><p>As if they were venting about the busy schedules they had while filming the drama, the film team were pouring bomb shots into their stomachs. Even the production employees, employees from TVL, and the celebrities unbuckled their belts and drank. People were drunk on alcohol and excitement at every table that they were causing a commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo! Here, here! Come and have a drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t even been ten minutes since I returned to Lee Songha\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Did they all decide to call out my name as their drinking habit? They\u2019ve been calling my name from all around for a while now. When I turned around, I saw it was the table of managers this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo, you\u2019re busy today,\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon chuckled beside me. He shook his round body left and right. Since Seo Jijoon, who was sitting beside him, wasn\u2019t good with alcohol, he took a few shots for him, and it seemed like he was drunk considering his face was red.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? It feels like they are calling my name more frequently than the waiters and waitresses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. Good. This industry runs on who you know, and this is proof their perception of you has changed; from one of the countless managers to someone worth befriending. It might also be that you\u2019ve become more approachable because of the entertainment show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he giggled again, saying that just looking at me made him laugh.</p><br/><p>While clicking my tongue, I looked to my side. Lee Songha was nodding and eating while listening to someone talk. It seemed she drank quite a bit of alcohol every time they toasted, yet her face didn\u2019t change in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stopped eating when a vibration rang from below the table.</p><br/><p>Seeing as it displayed \u2018Home\u2019, it seemed to be from her family. Lee Songha stared at the screen for a while before putting it in her pocket when the ringing stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s too noisy inside, you can call them outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s better if I don\u2019t answer now. I had some drinks too.\u201d</p><br/><p>She whispered after leaning her head towards me.</p><br/><p>Were her parents strict? While thinking this, the table of managers called my name out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, it looks like I have to go to that table over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, one second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha began collecting her glass, chopsticks, and plate. I quickly grabbed her shoulder since it seemed like she was going to follow me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you \u2018one second\u2019? Don\u2019t you see they\u2019ve made a mixture of beer, soju, and coke and are drinking it in bowlfuls? Just stay here with the chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sitting back down, Lee Songha looked at Chief Lee Bongjoon. I was on my way to the table calling my name out like a song after patting her small shoulders twice when I heard Chief Lee Bongjoon grumble,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Lee Songha. Don\u2019t you think the expressions you look at your manager and me with are too different? You\u2019re making me sober up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked back because I was curious of her expression, but I only saw the back of her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Sunwoo, come sit here. Sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only learned how funny Mr. Sunwoo is after watching the broadcast!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I sat in the empty seat, they began talking about Star Manager. It seemed that it would serve as my business card for a while. The ratings were clearly only 12%, but it felt like the entire country had seen it. Everyone knew it no matter which table I went.</p><br/><p>They changed the topic only after talking about my damn dark past and flattering me by saying that they thought I was a good person even though they found me difficult to approach.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that the drama\u2019s done too, all that\u2019s left is for Lee Songha to sweep the commercials. It seemed like she\u2019ll be in a ton of them? Advertisers like people like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope we get a variety of proposals.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I replied while smiling, someone said while sighing,</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, if you filmed and uploaded that, then she might even get a Korean barbecue restaurant commercial proposal. How can she eat meat so elegantly? What a waste to not film it, what a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Elegant?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bomb shots I had taken almost came out.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, Lee Songha was still eating voraciously amidst the celebrities. Since the mood was so good, it looked good no matter what she did. Still, if people looked at her carefully, they wouldn\u2019t say she was elegant. It would make sense if they said she ate heartily.</p><br/><p>A few more rounds of bomb shots passed.</p><br/><p>Since we were all managers, we naturally began talking about our work.</p><br/><p>We talked about what the celebrities we were assigned to were thinking about for their next project and about how it was difficult to choose because we were receiving too many synopses after the success of this project.</p><br/><p>There were even quite a few people asking me what I was thinking for Lee Songha\u2019 next project because Pan Production had told people that I picked Cat Guardian Ghost after reading its synopsis.</p><br/><p>The thin Chief Ju licked his lips as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo should develop Lee Songha further. She\u2019s good at acting, has good luck, and you never know, right? She might become a walking one-person company. Then you can quit your damn company and set up your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s not like W&amp;U is some mom-and-pop shop, his assigned celebrity will change a few times while he gains experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Kim joined in, shaking his head.</p><br/><p>The managers from the table next to us joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they are compatible, they might continue to work together. There are cases like Chief Lee Bongjoon and Seo Jijoon at W&amp;U. I bet if Chief Lee asks Seo Jijoon to leave with him, he will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ms. Lee Songha seems like she\u2019s willing to leave if you ask her to right now. They have a good relationship. I saw that she looked at you every time you moved tables. She also looked back whenever she heard your name being called out loud.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Ju replied to my question with a laid-back expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cKids always check to see if their moms are still there when they are dropped off at a playground. Something like that I guess. She\u2019s looking at you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, my eyes met Lee Songha\u2019s.</p><br/><p>We both blinked once before smiling simultaneously. Seeing this, Chief Lee Bongjoon tapped her shoulder and said something. I didn\u2019t know what he was saying, but she was listening carefully. I was curious if he was saying strange things again.</p><br/><p>I was looking for the opportunity to move back to that table when Chief Kim placed his empty glass down and tapped my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, I have something I want to talk to you about, mind if we step outside for a second?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at him in surprise since we weren\u2019t close. Beyond his glasses, his eyes curled into a smile.</p><br/><p>To sober up a little, we went outside.</p><br/><p>Facing the moist night breeze, I brushed my hair to the side. Maybe it was because it was the end of February, but sleet was raining down instead of snow.</p><br/><p>Chief Kim paused for a moment before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, I am just passing on what my superiors want to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, please say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any thoughts on moving to our company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked back because it was so sudden.</p><br/><p>It seemed I didn\u2019t hear wrong due to the influence of alcohol because Chief Kim said,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, under better conditions than the ones you have now and as a chief, how about it?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-84\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 84\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-86\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 86\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201283\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

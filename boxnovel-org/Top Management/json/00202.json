Entertainment reporters use it often because it can be used to package someone\u2019s character. Whether it\u2019s a producer or agency, anyone who has been moderately successful should have been called that. Myself included.\u201d</p><br/><p>He showed me his phone. Then, to show me, he tapped his screen. There was a headline that read, \u2018W&amp;U CEO Baek Hansung, Ascends as the Midas\u2019s Hand of the Entertainment World\u2019. It was an old interview article.</p><br/><p>Like he pointed out, the \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 title was common in the article column.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s rare for those with that title to really \u2018make everything they touch a hit\u2019. For someone to have only had hits with no failures up until now, from what I know, you\u2019re the only one. Even as a joke, if we created a film based on you, we\u2019d probably be criticized for the lack of realism.\u201d</p><br/><p>My life story really did lack realism.</p><br/><p>Having jokingly said this, CEO Baek Hansung stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporters these days don\u2019t use that title often. The title \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 has become analogous to you. That\u2019s why that common title now has strategic value. But about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He placed one of his chopsticks upright on the table. Then he let go of the top. The chopstick fell on the table, making a sharp sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat value is only effective while you have no failures. The moment you fail, it\u2019ll crumble like a sand castle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you telling me to maintain that title?\u201d</p><br/><p>By any means?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. To be exact, I was thinking about proactively managing your title at the company level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Manage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t sound good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike how you are managing Neptune and Nam Joyoon and building their image, the company will be managing you. As long as possible, so that you don\u2019t fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be managed by the company. Don\u2019t touch projects that have a high risk of failure.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you telling me to do whatever the company tells me to do from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that what it sounds like?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tilted his head and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying to do what the company expects from you as a team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team leader. I was confused whether he brought me up to that position of the title \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019. If that title decided my worth, then I would become someone unfitting of that position once I failed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that strategic value why I was quickly promoted to the team leader position?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say it didn\u2019t have an influence.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung willingly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, this is good for you. The company will help you grab success and will gold plate your career. This will also be a great investment for your future career.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, really? His words were sweet like honey, but my neck felt stiff. It felt like there was a leash on me.</p><br/><p>My voice sounded glum.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough there\u2019s nothing I can do if you\u2019re against the project because it\u2019s mediocre, I cannot easily accept that I should give it up simply to eliminate risk. Isn\u2019t filtering out \u2018projects we should risk\u2019 my responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, this is a sand castle that will crumble once you fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when a project is so great I believe we should take the risk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHand it over to another team\u2019s chief. If it succeeds, we\u2019ll publish an article that you recommended that project.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung replied with a still smiling face.</p><br/><p>I took a deep breath before opening my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if I try to persuade you to trust my judgment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His calm voice cut me off,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be very disappointed in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Was it because of this?</p><br/><p>Is this why I gave up City Jungle?</p><br/><p>Seeing CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s reaction, it was obvious that there was no room for persuasion. Then how much leeway did I have to make a decision? Did I even have any? His \u2018I\u2019ll be very disappointed\u2019 sounded to me as \u2018You\u2019ll fail\u2019.</p><br/><p>What would happen if City Jungle, which I gave up, became a success?</p><br/><p>Would CEO Baek Hansung regret his decision today and change his mind? No. I even brought up Cat Guardian Ghost to persuade him. If he was going to change his mind with another one, then he wouldn\u2019t have opposed it so definitively this time.</p><br/><p>He seemed to want to eliminate any potential risk of me failing.</p><br/><p>If things continued this way, how many projects like City Jungle would I have to give up?</p><br/><p>I sighed and raised my head. The cicadas overeagerly droned. In an alley devoid of any trees to provide you with shade, I saw a bunch of one-room apartments. This was a neighborhood I frequented around this time last year.</p><br/><p>I knocked on a familiar door. Soon, a low voice answered as the door opened. Nam Joyoon, with a bite-size peanut cereal bar in his mouth, looked at me with surprise. His eyes momentarily flashed with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just came over to see if you ate lunch yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon smiled and opened the door wide. The inside of his home was still dreary. There was a single bed and a knee-high desk stacked with scripts and scenarios. If we took them and the laptop out, you wouldn\u2019t think someone lived here. It would be believable to call this an empty unit ready for someone to move into.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just eati- about to eat. Did you eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, please give me one spoonful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I did eat an astronomically expensive wild samkyetang, I couldn\u2019t remember if it went in mouth or nose. I rubbed my empty stomach and glanced through the scenarios spread on the desk. Nam Joyoon, who paced back and forth in front of the sink, came over with a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo, there is no rice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I make some?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any rice. I definitely had some yesterday. Do you want instant noodles?\u201d</p><br/><p>So he was planning on simply eating a cereal bar today. It was clear as day.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, why does your living conditions seem worse than before you signed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Where did all the advanced pay for his movie appearance evaporate to? I heard that he was happy that he didn\u2019t have to pay rent every month after switching his rental agreement to a lease.<sup>{1}</sup> He still should have enough to have meat every meal.</p><br/><p>Since I sent him bundles of movie tickets, he shouldn\u2019t be spending it all on movie tickets like before either.</p><br/><p>Then why was the living condition\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to boil water. I have instant noodles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you boiling water in a frying pan? Where is your pot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bottom is all burnt up. I planned on buying another one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou planned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut not having one didn\u2019t bother me much.\u201d</p><br/><p>God, damn it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to change your incompetent lifestyle. If your private life was revealed on TV, you\u2019ll probably receive charity help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon simply rubbed his neck awkwardly and smiled.</p><br/><p>He took two instant noodle packages from the drawer. Seeing those packages, I thought that he at least wouldn\u2019t starve to death if he has that. Then I suddenly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck the expiry dates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been that long since I\u2019ve bought them. Instant noodles have a long shelf life.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Nam Joyoon kept his mouth shut once his eyes glanced over the back of the package.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat month is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I snatched the packages from his hand and checked their expiry dates.</p><br/><p>Oh, my god.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can there be expired instant noodles when you live alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat a lot of instant noodles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a plant? Do you only drink water? Do you even drink water?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I opened the fridge, there wasn\u2019t even a bottle of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to die at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said after rubbing my face. I was so dumbfounded that I laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had a very serious worry on my mind but seeing your living conditions pulled me back to reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a dog day, so I ordered steamed chicken and sat across Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon was clearing the top of his desk/dining table when he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was your serious worry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust company stuff. What did you do today, hyung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI read scenarios.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew it. Like an unchanging evergreen, he must have been reading scenarios yesterday, the day before that, last week, and even last month. I sent him as many scenarios and scripts as I could get my hands on, and every time, he looked happy like he had received a birthday present.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the project so entertaining that you forgot to eat? No, as long as it\u2019s disguised as a scenario, it\u2019s a bigger priority to you than food. Still, is it fun reading them every day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I enjoy most, so of course, it\u2019s fun every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he enjoys most, huh?</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon looked back at the wobbly tower of scenarios as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t read them if I wanted to before I met you. Since they were so hard to get. Back then, I read projects that appeared in online scenario markets or those that revealed their scenarios after their release. Now, just looking at these stacks of scenarios you got me makes me happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>For someone who didn\u2019t have anything to eat besides cereal bars and tap water, he sure looked lively and satisfied whenever he talked about scenarios.</p><br/><p>I ensured Nam Joyoon ate an entire chicken.</p><br/><p>Then I attended a meeting regarding Neptune\u2019s album activities and only returned late at night.</p><br/><p>Like Nam Joyoon\u2019s home, scenarios and scripts were stacked everywhere. There were some I found covered in dust in the boxes of synopses and others that I barely managed to obtain since their cast was already decided.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t make me happy like it did Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>Since I always read these while thinking about what would do well.</p><br/><p>Before working in this industry, I too looked for my favorite movie and drama scenarios and scripts online. I could vaguely remember a time when my heart raced because of how entertaining a scenario was.</p><br/><p>How did I feel when I read City Jungle?</p><br/><p>My heart did race thinking that this was going to be a smashing hit and even go to the Cannes Film Festival.</p><br/><p>I took a cold shower and laid down on my bed. I checked my phone to see messages I haven\u2019t read because I was at the meeting. Most were congratulatory messages about Neptune\u2019s consecutive hits in the music charts and schedule inquiries. While replying to each one, I discovered a familiar number.</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung.</p><br/><p>It was a long message. It started with a greeting, asking if I ate something nutritious because it was a dog day followed by praise about Neptune\u2019s album. Then she asked how everyone at W&amp;U, including me, were doing before cautiously asking if Nam Joyoon had a chance to read the City Jungle scenario.</p><br/><p>I hesitated for a good while with my fingers on the keyboard before kicking my blanket and getting up. It was going to be hard to get sleep with it being so hot and humid tonight, so I took the scenario that was carefully packed in an envelope out of my bag.</p><br/><p>I brewed a cup of coffee, returned to my bed, and turned on the floor lamp.</p><br/><p>Once again, I flipped the first page of the City Jungle scenario.</p><br/><p>An ill-tempered artist, who felt like the world was a dry desert, met an unordinary woman one day. Following the woman and experiencing crimes and violence, the artist became motivated and inspired. He jumps into that world without hesitation.</p><br/><p>I brooded over the scenario, which contained less than a hundred scenes. Some scenes were so terrifying that I had to brighten the lights, and there were other scenes that I read pacing in my room because I couldn\u2019t sit still.</p><br/><p>The text formed images in my mind.</p><br/><p>At some point, the woman\u2019s face had become Lee Songha\u2019s.</p><br/><p>And the artist\u2019s face was Nam Joyoon\u2019s. As though it was meant to be.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>My phone was sent to voicemail once more.</p><br/><p>I recorded another message before immediately getting in my minivan. The film production company Forest. This production company, which Director Oh Hyunkyung mentioned was producing City Jungle, had its sign on the fifth-floor of a corner building in Chungmuro.</p><br/><p>I joined others going to work and went on the elevator. What I saw the moment I got on the fifth floor were employees shrinking away with flustered faces and three angry individuals.</p><br/><p>The film company CEO, who I had seen a picture of in an interview article.</p><br/><p>And Director Oh Hyunkyung and Director Joo Jaechan.</p><br/><p>The three were shouting angrily like they were about to grab each other by the collar at any moment.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Korean rental markets work a little differently. Basically, Nam Joyoon went from paying monthly rent to just providing a security deposit, which he gets back when he moves out.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-201\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 201\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-203\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 203\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201512\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park got up after me.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, how can you get up like that?! I\u2019ll talk to the distributors again so don\u2019t get so worked up and sit back down. Let\u2019s talk it over while drinking some iced coffee. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what kind of ploy was this?</p><br/><p>When I frowned, Director Park said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Did you think I\u2019d cling to your pants? What to do? I don\u2019t have any plans on doing that. Mr. Jung Sunwoo, you aren\u2019t that great of a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, I must have scratched his pride.</p><br/><p>He was a great director who was filming a 10-billion-won movie.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Nam Joyoon, he\u2019s not that great of an actor. Even though his role has been reduced, I planned on giving him a few lines. Don\u2019t you know that this is an amazing opportunity for an unknown actor\u2019s filmography?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt worse than being sworn at.</p><br/><p>It felt like someone was stomping my precious thing in the dirt.</p><br/><p>I suddenly recalled the audition. I clearly remembered his smiling face as he hoped we would work together, happy with Nam Joyoon. I had thought we had met a good director that day. To think he was someone who revealed his true character when faced with money.</p><br/><p>God damn it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are tons of actors who will want to replace him immediately once I make a couple calls. And there\u2019d be a truck full of managers asking me to cast their actors! Are you not going to do this movie? How great. You\u2019re so full of yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled the saying that I had become sick of hearing since working in this industry.</p><br/><p>Endure even if it\u2019s unpleasant. If possible.</p><br/><p>Cooling my head, I thought, \u2018Did I have to endure this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Soon, I made my decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, director. It\u2019s a 10-billion-won film so, of course, we need to put up with it if it\u2019s for the project. No matter how small the role, we\u2019ll be grateful and work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you say that now, it\u2019s too la-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you were hoping for this kind of reaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park gave me a stupid look before his face distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on acting like that. It works out since both of us don\u2019t plan to. As a softie, I might have been in a difficult situation if you clung to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a manager, chief at best, yet you dare lash out at a director? Because broadcasts are inflating your ego by calling you a \u2018Star Manager\u2019, do directors look like pushovers to you? Do you not know how fast rumors spread in our industry? Are you not going to do any films in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou work in a big company like W&amp;U and Lee Songha becomes bigger day by day so it seems like you\u2019re not afraid of anything, but what about Nam Joyoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>The curses that rose up to my throat stopped in their tracks.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>I thought about Nam Joyoon, who loved acting and wanted to act so much that he said this damn movie set, where he was disregarded by the staff and sympathized by others, was fun and not to worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether he\u2019s good at acting or not, which director is going to cast an unknown actor with a history like him? Acting like this, you are crushing his acting career! Do you know that? If you\u2019re confident to take responsibility-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, the trailer door burst open.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon entered and locked the door behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you might get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Get hurt?</p><br/><p>Before I could even finish my thought, Nam Joyoon pulled my arm. Even though he had a slim figure, his strength was incredible. Instantly, I was pulled to the entrance, and Nam Joyoon turned his back on me.</p><br/><p>His back looked fierce, unlike his usual self. I unconsciously gulped dryly.</p><br/><p>Thud. Just as I thought Nam Joyoon calmly grabbed the patio chair, the chair instantly crashed on Director Park\u2019s table and rolled away. Crashing sounds pierced my ears. The patio table and glass cups shattered in pieces.</p><br/><p>Stepping on the shattered glass, Nam Joyoon grabbed the corner of the table.</p><br/><p>With an incredible sound, the table was slammed into the corner of the trailer. The stacks of paper fluttered in the air and slapped a blank Director Park\u2019s cheeks as they fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cAr-are you crazy?! You bastard, just what are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Director Park shouted at me,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung! Mr. Jung Sunwoo! Why aren\u2019t you stopping him?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I have some things to think about\u2026 Continue what you were doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did the W&amp;U legal team employee say?</p><br/><p>That if my celebrity caused an incident, the first thing to check was whether there were any cameras. As long as there wasn\u2019t any physical evidence, they would be able to take care of it.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see\u2026 It doesn\u2019t seem like there were any cameras in the trailer?</p><br/><p>Relieved, I leaned my back against the trailer door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Where do crazy bastards like you come from?! Nam Joyoon! If rumors about this spread-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpread the,.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said, standing in front of Director Park.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpread rumors that the bastard named Nam Joyoon burst into your trailer and threw your table and stuff. Rumors about me are already so bad that something like that won\u2019t even leave a mark. So do what you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was calm, but his words were threatening.</p><br/><p>Although I could only see his back, it seemed like he had a fierce expression as well, seeing the mad Director Park flinch back in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, if I hear that you spread rumors about the chief\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon took something out from his pocket.</p><br/><p>It was the folding knife I had seen before.</p><br/><p>The one that he had brought to the audition.</p><br/><p>He unfolded and folded the knife. Just like when Director Park shouted that he passed in excitement. The folding knife moved skillfully in his hand.</p><br/><p>To Director Park, whose eyes were trembling, Nam Joyoon said in a hoarse voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYo-you crazy bastard! You\u2019re not a gangster, yet it\u2019s not enough that you wrecked havoc in my trailer, you dare threaten me?! Don\u2019t even think about acting in this industry! Do you think I\u2019ll sit still while you act like this? By any means, I wil-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sit still.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said instead of Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on sitting still either.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for showing you such a poor appearance. You were shocked, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon, who was sitting in the passenger seat, said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I was shocked. Even though I look like this, I lived my life protected like an orchid.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said jokingly. Because Director Park\u2019s nonsense still rang in my ears, I might unconsciously step on the gas if I didn\u2019t actively try to calm down like this.</p><br/><p>After tapping the steering wheel, I looked beside me.</p><br/><p>Flames were surging inside me, yet the person in question, Nam Joyoon, lowered his head and was fussing with his pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are tiny pieces of glass on my pants. Ms. Soojeong got these for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlass?\u201d</p><br/><p>The stylist stuck her head out from the rear seat with the same fierce expression she had when arguing with the assistant director. At least in this van, I wasn\u2019t the only one who was angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened in the trailer for glass to get stuck on your clothes? Did you really mean it when you said poor appearance? Oh my god. Did the director throw a glass cup at you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who threw it was this person though.</p><br/><p>I feigned ignorance, but the stylist erupted in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you just took it? Chief Jung, say something! Do you know how much Mr. Nam Joyoon was pushed around while you were gone? How is someone as meek as him survive in the entertainment industry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Soojeong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon called her name, but she snorted and continued to speak,</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though people aren\u2019t treated like people if you\u2019re not famous in this industry, there\u2019s a limit to that! They treated you horribly, yet you endured it again and again to be in the movie! It was so frustrating seeing you like that! Ah, so frustrating!\u201d</p><br/><p>The stylist beat her chest.</p><br/><p>I almost stepped on the gas again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhenever I try to say something, you always say, \u2018Ms. Soojeong, it\u2019s okay,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll deal with it,\u2019 deal with what?! When I told you to tell Chief Jung, you kept telling me not to-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Soojeong, please stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s voice lowered.</p><br/><p>The stylist opened and closed her mouth, but Nam Joyoon shook his head.</p><br/><p>After dropping the frustrated stylist in Yeouido, I drove towards Han River. The grassy field was packed with people. I parked my minivan in a moderately quiet place.</p><br/><p>Then I opened a drink that I had bought at a convenience store as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you became human with age.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon looked confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time, when I asked you if you were okay with the \u2018crazy bastard\u2019 role in this movie. You said that you would do well and to not worry. That you became human with age. To be honest, I didn\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite familiar with things getting thrown around, but it was my first time seeing a chair and table be thrown.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took a sip of the cool drink then asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you could act like that, how did you endure it for so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>I went straight to the point.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon looked at me with an odd expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have told me. Did you not trust me? Because the director and large distributor were pushing you around and going on about a 10-billion-won movie, did you think there was no point in telling me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell me? I didn\u2019t know things like that were going on and thought everything was going well. I\u2019m the one who persuaded you, saying that I was good at my job and to work together with me. I\u2019m also the one who introduced you to this damn movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was extremely embarrassed but also angry.</p><br/><p>I was frustrated at Nam Joyoon who didn\u2019t say a word about it and just endured their treatment of him. I pitied him because he endured all that because he so dearly wanted to act despite his unfortunate circumstances.</p><br/><p>He endured it for so long, yet he ended up slamming a table in front of the director.</p><br/><p>Because he was worried Director Park would spread bad rumors about me.</p><br/><p>I crushed the empty can in my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt yourself like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he said this, the soda tab ripped off and its sharp aluminum edge scratched my palm. Red blood began to flow. It flowed down my wrist and dripped onto the steering wheel.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon took the empty can and tossed it in the rear seat then examined my hand.</p><br/><p>He took out a band-aid from his worn wallet and handed it to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you carry that around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a habit.\u201d</p><br/><p>I awkwardly put the band-aid on with my left hand when Nam Joyoon quietly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t trust you. I couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s voice became even quieter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure myself, yet you said that you liked my acting. You helped me even by asking favors from other people. You even got me an opportunity to be in a movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only natural.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really wanted to do well this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon revealed a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m someone whose life\u2019s already messed up as it is, and it\u2019s not my first time failing. But that\u2019s not the same for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon, who had been looking directly at me, lowered his gaze slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the first failure in your management career.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Failure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never failed since you\u2019ve started working in this industry, If you didn\u2019t involve yourself with the unlucky me, today\u2019s incident wouldn\u2019t have happened\u2026 So you can stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you saw, my luck is terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my luck is terribly good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s eyes bulged at my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you not hear it? The rumor that everything I touch is a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t worry. My luck is terribly good so if we calculate the negatives and positives, we\u2019ll still end up in the green.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s expression became complicated.</p><br/><p>Just then, a ringtone rang out.</p><br/><p>It was my phone. When I checked the screen, it was the female employee of the PR Team.</p><br/><p>As soon as I answered, the female employee rattled on.</p><br/><p>-Mr. Sunwoo! Mr. Sunwoo, where are you right now? Where are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cAt Han River. I have some personal matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Check the internet right now! Articles about you are being published like crazy!</p><br/><p>As if he heard her voice, Nam Joyoon took out his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s expression became rigid. I quickly scanned content on his screen. Articles that have been published for less than a minute were popping up like crazy. Their headlines were similar.</p><br/><p>[{The Midas\u2019s Hand that brought Lee Songha to stardom, Jung Sunwoo\u2019s next movie?]}[{Jung Sunwoo, who created an international star, returned temporarily because of a new movie? What kind of movie is it?]}[{Will Jung Sunwoo\u2019s new movie be a hit? The film industry is turning its focus on it]}\u00a0</p><br/><p>-I don\u2019t know where the rumors started, but the distributor known as Ace is charging forward in a frenzy! They are using your and Ms. Songha\u2019s names to promote their movie! Just what is going on? No, first, tell me if this is fake so that we can-!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I already told Team Leader Park, but it seems you didn\u2019t hear about it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>She paused when she heard my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let it be. I\u2019m the one who started it.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Pardon? What did you say?</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s eyes bulged as he looked at me.</p><br/><p>I smiled and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI set this up on purpose.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-129\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 129\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-131\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 131\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201372\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

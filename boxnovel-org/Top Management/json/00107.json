I was so surprised that I almost swore.</p><br/><p>What the heck? Why did she answer her phone? Did she need someone to curse?</p><br/><p>-Hello? Hello! What the heck? It\u2019s definitely the hateful guy.</p><br/><p>Did she have my number saved as the \u2018hateful guy\u2019? Well, I won in that regar-</p><br/><p>I shook my head as I was about to escape from reality.</p><br/><p>-Can\u2019t you hear me? I\u2019m going to hang up if you don\u2019t answer in three seconds. Three, two, one, what is it?</p><br/><p>You said you were going to hang up!</p><br/><p>I quietly clicked my tongue before examining the faces of those in front of me. The team 2 leader and the others were still looking at me. They seemed to think that the phone was still ringing. How would it look if, for whatever reason, Son Chaeyoung, who didn\u2019t pick up when the team 2 leader called, answered my call?</p><br/><p>Hmmm, let\u2019s act like she didn\u2019t pick up.</p><br/><p>I hung up after deciding. Good. It looked natural.</p><br/><p>I was calmly putting away my phone when someone asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear a voice before you hung up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it, someone\u2019s ears were needlessly sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed like a woman\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doubtful gazes fixated on my phone. In return, my hand trembled. I thought I suddenly developed hand tremors, but it was my phone vibrating. While only moving my eyes to look downwards, I glanced at the name on my phone screen.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader approached me with suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who do you think? It\u2019s the crazy bitch in this neighborhood.</p><br/><p>The vibrations didn\u2019t stop, and the team 2 leader seemed like he was about to snatch my phone away from me. It was too late to act dumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes widened as though they would pop out of their sockets. They were giving me such weird looks that it felt like I wasn\u2019t holding my phone but grabbing Son Chaeyoung by her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is she\u2026 Never mind. Answer it first. Quickly! Before she hangs up!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I paused, the team 2 leader quickly gestured with his hands as he urged me to answer the phone. I frowned and made a somber expression. While acting like I was very uneasy in answering this phone call, I answered the phone,</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-What the hell? It is you. I thought I might be the team leader.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung mumbled as though she found this unexpected.</p><br/><p>Because everyone was straining their ears, the room became so quiet you couldn\u2019t even hear a single breath. The team 2 leader mouthing something. What was he saying? When I showed him a face that read I had no idea what he was saying, he hastily wrote a memo on his phone and showed it to me.</p><br/><p>{Speakerphone!}</p><br/><p>Ah. When I pressed the speakerphone button, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s voice filled the room.</p><br/><p>-Wait, did the team leader make you call me? Are you with the team leader right now?</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader swiftly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Then what? Why did you call me?</p><br/><p>What reason did I have to call Son Chaeyoung? Damn it, there were none.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader urgently wrote another memo and showed it to me.</p><br/><p>{Ask her where she is right now! Just figure that out!}</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Why are you asking me that?</p><br/><p>I know, right? The team 2 leader seemed taken aback as he repeated wrote and deleted memos on his phone. The other employees were mouthing words next to him. This wasn\u2019t some silent comedy film. Someone scribbled something on his phone and showed it to me.</p><br/><p>{Because I want to see you?}</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I wa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this guy crazy? I almost read that out loud.</p><br/><p>When I gave him a dumbfounded look, the chief made a face that seemed to recognize his mistake. It seemed that he only now realized that Son Chaeyoung and I met on a single log bridge instead of a bridge of birds.<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>-What? Hello? Hello! Why aren\u2019t you saying anything again? Why are you still carrying around this trashy phone when I told you to change it already? Because what?</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s speech and tone were no different from normal. From what I heard, it seemed Chief Jo, who had reached his mental limit, shouted at Son Chaeyoung, telling her to get off the van, and Son Chaeyoung really got off in the middle of the road and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Seeing as she wasn\u2019t shouting, was she still outside? I couldn\u2019t any other noises though.</p><br/><p>Since the other people were still mouthing ideas, I decided to make something up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I thought I saw you.\u201d</p><br/><p>-What?</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I saw someone who looked like you just now on the street.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even I thought it was just baseless nonsense. The team 2 leader\u2019s face flushed. It seemed he was anxious Son Chaeyoung would figure the situation out and hang up. Feeling urgent, my mouth had moved on its own.</p><br/><p>After a moment\u2019s silence, Son Chaeyoung snorted.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m home right now. What similar person? Do you think a face like mine is common?</p><br/><p>Now really, the people around her were a mess while the heart of the storm was at home.</p><br/><p>I looked at the team 2 leader. He looked like he was texting Chief Jo, but his face was clearly one of relief. It seemed like there was no reason to keep talking to her. Just as I was about to hang up after thinking that was it, Son Chaeyoung continued to speak as though she was strangely happy.</p><br/><p>-Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.</p><br/><p>The point?</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m telling you to stop wasting time since I already know what it is.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>-I was wondering how long you would play your game of \u2018house\u2019, but have you finally come to face reality? You want to work with me-</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my battery.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hung up. I didn\u2019t want to hear what she had to say through the speakerphone since it would undoubtedly be the continuation of the ridiculous proposal last time. I clearly refused that time. I really couldn\u2019t tell what went on inside her head.</p><br/><p>I completely turned my phone off just in case she called again.</p><br/><p>I felt people\u2019s gazes as they were taken aback, especially the team 2 leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you, to-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It felt suffocating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I continued with the most depressed voice I could make,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m am suffering from a stress disorder ever since the unpleasant clash with Ms. Son Chaeyoung in the past. Just hearing her voice makes my chest feel stuffy and as though I\u2019m suffocating. It feels like my soul is being hit by a dump truck.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader showed a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>You should know my relationship with Son Chaeyoung well enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that bad? Listening to the phone call, it didn\u2019t seem that bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is that bad. It couldn\u2019t be worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, you were able to talk with her. Hey, why don\u2019t you look after Cha-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was fortunate that the CEO took my circumstances into consideration when Son Chaeyoung asked him to switch my assignment to her. If I was assigned to her, I might be going to a mental hospital instead of work.\u201d</p><br/><p>I used CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s name. Rather than bringing up Neptune and the team 3 leader\u2019s names, this was probably more effective since it would be difficult for the team 2 leader to blindly force me when even the CEO said he would leave the decision to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, he did. The CEO\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader clicked his tongue as he looked at me as though it was a shame. I was worried that he might look at me in a worse light than before now that I straightforwardly refused his proposal, but it didn\u2019t seem like it.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t anyone else but Son Chaeyoung. Even the Team 2 employees looked like they wanted to avoid this human natural disaster. The fact that Son Chaeyoung built up a worse name for herself recently actually worked in my favor.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader clicked his tongue and patted my elbow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if a situation like this comes up again, could you at least\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, when the meeting began, I was the one who had a request, but now, our positions had changed a little. I licked my dry lips. It seemed like the ideal opportunity to say what I had been waiting to say had arrived again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, but team leader. I have something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an unknown actor I\u2019m interested in, could I show you his profile?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActor? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave the team 2 leader a simple introduction of Nam Joyoon. Like how I had promoted Neptune to broadcast producers, good points about him flowed from my mouth. Though it looked like it was the first time the team 2 leader was hearing Nam Joyoon\u2019s name, he seemed interested in what I was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if your discerning eye is even half as good as the rumors, you won\u2019t bring up someone ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>He mumbled before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cSend me his profile.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, I found out Nam Joyoon\u2019s phone number and received his profile.</p><br/><p>While we were talking for a short time on the phone, he didn\u2019t ask about the contract or try to strongly promote himself. All that returned as a polite greeting, saying how he was thankful that I thought favorably of him.</p><br/><p>I sent his profile to the team 2 leader before jumping into my schedule, from settling the empty spot the traitor had left behind to taking over as a chief. I was incredibly busy.</p><br/><p>I thought it would take longer before the team 2 leader responded, but I received a call within a day, saying that he wanted to set up a meeting.</p><br/><p>The next time I met Nam Joyoon was when I came to give him a ride to the meeting.</p><br/><p>In an alley with a few rays of sunlight, Nam Joyoon walked down stairs that were as dry and worn as he was. He clearly looked like he paid more attention to his outfit than when we first met on set.</p><br/><p>His hair was combed, and he wore a grey dress shirt instead of the faded t-shirt. They didn\u2019t seem to be his own clothes as the dress shirt was too big on his chest and the slacks were so short that his ankles were visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon, who got in the passenger\u2019s seat, had a difficult time speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to ask last time, but I endured it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you can say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded casually. Internally, I was anxious.</p><br/><p>I was constantly worried that maybe he had come with high expectations. While we were able to arrange a meeting smoothly, it wasn\u2019t certain whether he would be able to sign an exclusive contract or not.</p><br/><p>However, what Nam Joyoon said next wasn\u2019t about the contract.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose scenarios, would it be okay to read them for a bit while we\u2019re driving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scenarios?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they are projects I\u2019m seeing for the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>His focus was on the stack of scenarios placed in the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel free to. Though I can\u2019t show them to the public since they haven\u2019t started filming yet, it\u2019s fine if you read them here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon lowered his head and held the scenarios in his hands. As though they were national treasures, he was very careful whenever he flipped a page.</p><br/><p>The change was like rain falling on a dry wasteland. With vivid eyes, they were only fixated on the scenarios. Even when we arrived at the company parking lot, he didn\u2019t mention the contract even once.</p><br/><p>His expression as he got off the minivan without the scenarios looked so sad that, if it wasn\u2019t for the meeting, I would have let him read them the entire day.</p><br/><p>I sent Nam Joyoon to a Team 2 employee before going to my office to finish up my work. My hands were working quickly, but my progress was slow. I couldn\u2019t concentrate at all because of the meeting.</p><br/><p>Unlike Neptune, who I was assigned to as soon as I joined the company, I felt a sense of responsibility for bringing Nam Joyoon here myself.</p><br/><p>Anyways, I straightened my nervousness and waited.</p><br/><p>I hoped the team 2 leader would see something in him like I had.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone suddenly said behind me. Fox-like eyes. It was that person. Chief Sung who treated me friendlily during the meeting with Im Joowon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s- wait a second. This isn\u2019t a good place for whistle-blowing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whistle-blowing?</p><br/><p>Chief Sung glanced at the employee in the office before gesturing outside with his chin. We immediately moved to the emergency stairs, where a shivering chill rubbed against our skin.</p><br/><p>Chief Sung brushed a step and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also looked at Mr. Nam Joyoon\u2019s profile, but his profile wasn\u2019t one that was good enough to arrange a meeting. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it\u2019s strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis profile isn\u2019t good enough for a meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked with a frown, Chief Sung nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat actor, he ended his relationship with his previous company with a lawsuit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were circumstances behind that. It was a place with a lot of problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe circumstances aren\u2019t very important. What\u2019s important is that it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Sung explained while using hand gestures.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe receive a ton of profiles from suggestions or that were brought over by casting managers. We are looking for actors worth signing an exclusive contract amongst them, but that\u2019s not something that can be decided by one or two people. Unless the actor is outstandingly good, usually, we hold meetings in which we undergo a process of removing those that are less good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemoving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019His reputation isn\u2019t so good, take him out.\u2019 \u2018I heard he had surgery, remove him.\u2019 Since they are all good actors, they get removed from the list due to trivial things. Ended his relationship with his previous company with a lawsuit? Of course, he\u2019ll be removed. That\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t someone who usually get a meeting in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Nam Joyoon was in a meeting right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of two things. The team leader discovered something special about Mr. Nam Joyoon or he wants something. But I think it\u2019s the latter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Sung scratched his chin as if indicating this was the key point.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe definitely has something he wants from Chief Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the meeting, Nam Joyoon came out of the meeting room. When I looked at the time, only 20 minutes had passed. Nam Joyoon came up to me with the same expression he had when going into the meeting. I couldn\u2019t tell what they talked about from that expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for giving me this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I did it because I wanted to. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as I know the results.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon smiled faintly at my words.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, I realized that worrying about what to do if he was disappointed after getting his hopes up was useless. He probably didn\u2019t have high hopes in signing with W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>The only one who did was me.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon took a few steps then turned around to look at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a meal when I get paid from my part-time job. Also, could I continue to read the scenario I was reading before?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I nodded, Nam Joyoon went back with a smile.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, the team 2 leader called me to an empty meeting room as though he had been waiting for me. If what Chief Sung had said was true, then I could only think of one thing that that man wanted.</p><br/><p>While I was waiting while mulling over it, the team 2 leader entered the meeting room, holding two cups of coffee.</p><br/><p>Though I did accept a cup, the coffee today looked like poison today.</p><br/><p>Preparing to reply to the team 2 leader\u2019s words, I wet my mouth with the coffee. Just then, the team 2 leader, who had been giving me a meaningful look, suddenly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what do you think about transferring to Team 2 now?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Single Log Bridge is from an idiom: Encountering your enemy on a single log bridge \u2013 meaning encountering bad luck at the worst place and time.

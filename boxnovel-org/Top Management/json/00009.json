The meeting place was a hurriedly reserved high-class sushi restaurant. Although we didn\u2019t know if we were going to attend, Hyunjo dragged us there saying it was a good idea to show our faces to the CEO.</p><br/><p>I simply breathed while following behind Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I wasn\u2019t in my right mind since a while ago.</p><br/><p>Hahaha. How could I be in my right mind? Considering the waves crashing down on my life today, it was good enough that I didn\u2019t suffer a heart attack.</p><br/><p>I was relieved thinking my mind wasn\u2019t as weak as I thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ve arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first to arrive were from W&amp;U. The management business director was a middle-aged man whose head was starting to bald while the management team 3 leader was a man in his mid-thirties with a pleasant impression.</p><br/><p>And lastly, the man who got out of the Rolls Royce was the CEO, the man who I had only seen in pictures in interviews. He was the role model for me who was dreaming of becoming the CEO of a management company.</p><br/><p>Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>My mind sobered up as soon as I saw him.</p><br/><p>He looked 10 years younger than his real age of forty-seven and his body revealed that he exercised regularly. He was wearing a high-quality suit under a cashmere coat, but his appearance\u2026 He looked like he could be the cover model for a men\u2019s magazine.</p><br/><p>Above all, his actions were filled with confidence and dignity. Of course, he was someone who could be dignified. He had built a huge management company like W&amp;U starting from a 1-man agency. The skilled of the skilled. The business man of business men.</p><br/><p>While greeting them, I made eye contact with CEO Baek Hansung. Very briefly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys did well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned after lightly patting Gunyoung and my shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go. The people from Knet haven\u2019t arrived yet, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Should we come with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Hyunjo asked, CEO Baek Hansung shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNah. Leave the business to us and you guys wait for the good news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then CEO Baek Hansung led the director and team 3 leader into the sushi restaurant.</p><br/><p>It has already been 4 hours since we have been waiting for the good news. It was 1 a.m. right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of sushi are they eating for hours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nervousness was present in Gunyoung\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>We were waiting after ordering chicken in a 24-hour bar. Just in case we would have to meet with the CEO or the director, we couldn\u2019t even take a sip of alcohol.</p><br/><p>Hyunjo answered while piercing a piece of cold chicken.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think they were eating sushi all this time? They probably moved to the next place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do think things are going? I\u2019m so curious I could die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that they are taking their time. If the talk wasn\u2019t going well, they would have already ended.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were checking the time while shaking their legs. The only one who was quiet at the table was me. I was in thought. Continuously for 4 hours, continuously thinking.</p><br/><p>What exactly did I see?</p><br/><p>When I first saw it in the morning, I thought it was just a dream, but there was no way that was true. I definitely saw it when I was awake with my eyes open while standing and I woke up in the same state. If it was narcolepsy, then I would have already had my skull split open on the washroom tiles. So it definitely wasn\u2019t a dream.</p><br/><p>Then what was it?</p><br/><p>Supernatural ability? Was it something like foresight?</p><br/><p>I recalled the movies and dramas that had supernatural beings or superheroes. There were a variety of methods of which they would be able to look into the future, from knowing what would happen a minute from the present to drawing the future.</p><br/><p>Did I just get a supernatural ability like that?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t those that contracted supernatural powers get them from getting bitten by radioactive insects, a vampire or experience some other special circumstances?</p><br/><p>But, what about me?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have anything happen to me. What was this?!</p><br/><p>Hoooo. Let\u2019s not get excited. Let\u2019s calmly think about it one more time.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know why I was given this ability. I didn\u2019t know how to use my ability. However, if you thought about it, it was something to get excited over. Anyone would have the same thoughts.</p><br/><p>Supernatural ability, it was a supernatural ability!</p><br/><p>Of course, if I was to receive a supernatural ability, I would have preferred teleportation or invisibility, but foresight was good as well. It was cool, even mysterious. If this was a movie, it was an ability that would be of great importance!</p><br/><p>Ehahahahaha! I am a supernatural being! Yay!</p><br/><p>Now, was it time for aliens to appear? Was it?!</p><br/><p>\u2026Damn! I couldn\u2019t calm down!</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I abruptly lifted my head and saw Hyunjo looking at me. My excitement slowly died down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I was just thinking\u2026 I\u2019m feeling a bit out of it after experiencing everything today.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like he thought I was nodding off since my head was lowered. I tried to show I wasn\u2019t sleeping by opening my eyes really wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, today was your first day. I forgot because of what happened today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo pushed aside the cold chicken and handed us a menu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two can choose whatever you want to eat. Instead of looking like you\u2019re being punished, should we relax and have a beer? Let\u2019s consider it a welcoming party.\u201d</p><br/><p>We ordered barbecue chicken dripping with oil along with freshwater snails, fries and fish cake soup to warm our bellies. The owner who would show a dissatisfied expression whenever he passed us gave us a friendly smile as he got us our beers.</p><br/><p>My heart felt refreshed after drinking the bubbly beer. After I downed a pint in an instant, Hyunjo pressed the bell again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t seem like they are going to call for us so drink more. You can drink a lot today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI meant you did a good job. When I first saw a pale guy wearing a suit, I thought where did this guy come from\u2026 But, even without telling you to, you went and introduced the girls to a producer and got them a chance. Do all people with quadruplet nieces and nephews act that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sincere compliment made me feel many times better than the beer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy luck was good. The producer and the manager of Lemon Girls were talking about the group dropping out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, the timing and luck were unbelievably good, but if it wasn\u2019t for you grabbing onto that chance and not letting go, we would have lost it. I heard you were very passionate?\u201d</p><br/><p>I bashfully scratched my cheek. It was hard to control my expression. Compliments from work were very different from the ones from family and school. I felt proud as it felt like my existence as an employee was acknowledged.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t see the future, I probably would have lost this chance.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even know who Producer Go Joontae was or that Knet was launching a program called Next K-Star. Even if I did, I could have hesitated whether or not I should talk with the producer and eventually turn my back on it.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, things would have proceeded the way my future self said, the Lucky Charm of the company would have been Gunyoung.</p><br/><p>I looked over at Gunyoung while drinking beer. It would have been normal if he was unhappy that I was the only one who got complimented on our first day, but he was actually assisting Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t see the future and told Gunyoung about Producer Joontae, would he really have tricked me?</p><br/><p>I remembered what Reporter Song had said.</p><br/><p>\u2018So that person was like that even then.\u2019</p><br/><p>The good person, Choi Gunyoung. The person who I thought I would work well with, Choi Gunyoung. I wondered what kind of person he really was\u2026</p><br/><p>One thing that was certain was he was someone I had to put my guard up against.</p><br/><p>However, I couldn\u2019t openly push him away. We were in a situation where, unless one was assigned to a different team, we would have to work together.</p><br/><p>I would only become the bad guy if I pushed him away for no apparent reason and if I was to tell Gunyoung, \u2018I think you will backstab me, so I don\u2019t think I can be friendly with you,\u2019 I would become the crazy person\u2026 Sigh.</p><br/><p>I never had to face a more complicated problem in my life. To have to work with the guy who backstabbed, no, who might backstab me\u2026 Was this \u2018Sleeping with the enemy\u2019?</p><br/><p>On top of that, although I knew that the truth, I might end up unconsciously dropping my guard since he really did look like a good guy.</p><br/><p>I have to be careful. If I were to get backstabbed even while knowing this fact, I would be a loser, a loser.</p><br/><p>To reinforce my guard against him, I decided to call Gunyoung traitor from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Gunyoung did well today as well. Quick witted and sociable, anyone would think you\u2019ve worked here for a few years. It was because of Mr. Gunyoung, the music broadcast was able to go so smoothly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have another round. Don\u2019t tell me you guys are drunk after 2 pints?\u201d</p><br/><p>Two became three, then three became four. We drank unceasingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, what time is it right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c4:30. But chief, please speak casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I am more comfortable this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>When you were mad, you seemed really comfortable talking casually.</p><br/><p>Well, it was a really long day today. I didn\u2019t imagine my first day to be like this. How was it I was unable to leave even at 4:30 when I started at 3 a.m. yesterday?</p><br/><p>Was there anyone in the world who experienced their first day like me? Besides the traitor.</p><br/><p>There was still no news from the CEO. Just what in the world were these people doing? 3<sup>rd</sup>, no, they probably moved to the 4<sup>th</sup> place by now.</p><br/><p>Although it was certain Neptune would appear on the show as I didn\u2019t know the process of when and how they joined, it was really frustrating. No matter how quick things proceeded, it wasn\u2019t like things would be decided just like that, maybe it would take 2-3 days?</p><br/><p>Once we ordered pints of beer, it just ended up being eating and drinking event. We kept ordering more beers and extra sides.</p><br/><p>Then 5 in the morning. The moment we had been waiting for had come, the phone began to ring.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-8\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 8\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-10\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 10\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201130\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

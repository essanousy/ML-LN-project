His true thoughts were \u2018Since I\u2019ve apologized like this, let\u2019s just forget about what happened in the past. You\u2019re going to keep doing Good Friends anyways. Since we\u2019re on the same boat, let\u2019s just quickly make up and row together.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was true if we only thought about the business side of things.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like I could act rashly because I didn\u2019t like him when IBC was working hard on the reality TV show. I also had to appear on Good Friends\u2019 long-term project because a verbal contract was still a contract.</p><br/><p>Punching in all the numbers, it would be best to erase Producer Choi\u2019s faults and make him pay more attention to our girls. So I should make a sour look right now but accept his apology at the right opportunity.</p><br/><p>I knew this, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, since you\u2019re already here, why don\u2019t we discuss our long-term project\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This man was too detestable to just gloss over his actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can right now. I came to meet with General Manager Jo. We decided to meet once he was finished with his meeting with the director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? General Manager Jo is in the director\u2019s office right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was he surprised?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he went to discuss the reality TV show\u2019s timeslot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Manager Hwang also went to the director\u2019s office not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Good Friends out so you can go in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director of the Entertainment Department said.</p><br/><p>Before General Manager Jo could reply, General Manager Hwang jumped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to take it out? Didn\u2019t you say that you were going to trust Producer Choi a bit longer during the restructuring meeting? He\u2019s been working hard preparing for the long-term project proposal he showed you! If you do this now, then\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said we\u2019re ending it? Since the format is going to change, just publicly say that we are preparing for Season 2 and tell the staff and cast members to wait. During that time, we\u2019ll air the reality TV show.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang\u2019s shocked demeanor calmed slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, then I\u2019ll tell Producer Choi to prepare for the next season\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to tell him to wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director cut him off.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll depend on how Yoo Sooyoung makes the reality TV show. If it\u2019s good, we\u2019re going to change out Good Friends\u2019 main producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang stiffened like he was struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>General Manager Jo was also surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hand it over to Producer Yoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that she had good ratings in the Documentary Department.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like her skill is going anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre entertainment shows and documentaries the same? Director! Yoo Sooyoung hasn\u2019t had an entertainment show for three years! She must have lost her touch from caring for her baby and leisurely filming documentaries, so how can we suddenly assign a regular program to her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s sudden? I told you we\u2019ll see her results.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director frowned.</p><br/><p>Loud noises continued for a while inside the director\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Then, not long after, the two general managers got on the phone as soon as they left the office.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Carbonation rose up inside me. It swept through my frustration like a tsunami.</p><br/><p>General Manager Jo\u2019s words on the phone were as sweet as a heavenly trumpet. My lips curled on their own. On the other hand, Producer Choi, who was sitting across from me, looked like he was about to drown. I could hear General Manager Hwang\u2019s shouts from here.</p><br/><p>My heart rate quickened as I took in the sight.</p><br/><p>Was this a mental orgasm?</p><br/><p>I hung up after we decided to talk details in his office. Then I stood up without any hesitation. Producer Choi Byungsoo, who was still on the phone, staggered up with his hand outstretched, as though he was trying to grab me.</p><br/><p>I lightly shook his hand before letting go.</p><br/><p>I tried to make my bright smile seem sad as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to delay our meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Chief Jung. General manager, wait, chief, umm\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Manager Jo is urgently looking for me right now, so I\u2019ll see you next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I didn\u2019t know whether there would be a next time.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>How long had it been since things had gone so smoothly?</p><br/><p>When something was resolved, another problem arose. When two concerns were settled, two more would pop up. These would occur on the daily, but now I was calm like I had finally achieved inner peace.</p><br/><p>Yeah, there need to be times like this in life.</p><br/><p>My life had been too eventful until now.</p><br/><p>Alive quickly exceeded ten million viewers and was competing for the record. After Nam Joyoon had a photo shoot and did an interview, he was becoming known as one of the talented rookies recognized by Chungmuro<sup>{1}</sup>.</p><br/><p>Good. It was very good.</p><br/><p>Royal Family\u2019s ratings exceeded 35%. It was Lee Songha\u2019s debut onto the public network so there were rumors PBS was considering which award to give her at the award ceremony. The majority thought she had the rookie award in the bag.</p><br/><p>It was hard for things to be better than this.</p><br/><p>All that was left was Neptune\u2019s official album and Pretty Girls\u2019 single project.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because I was immersed in my inner peace, but I didn\u2019t think that we would fail.</p><br/><p>This thought was further reinforced once we started filming the reality TV show.</p><br/><p>Neptune and Pretty Girls\u2019 goldfish\u2019s first meeting. The day Neptune showed the goldfish around W&amp;U\u2019s practice room and recording studio like museum curators.</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung grinned when she saw the goldfish following them like elementary schoolers. She was blinding. Within the few days of returning to entertainment shows, she started to shine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we can edit Pretty Girls\u2019 screen time with our feet.\u201d<sup>{2}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a compliment, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are young, cute, and sad. If we can maintain that image, there\u2019s nothing more we need to do. The viewers will support them, hoping they become popular. If we promote the idea that the viewers need to stay interested in Pretty Girls and that listening to their new song is important, then they\u2019ll also have the mindset that they\u2019re helping Pretty Girls succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung said as though she was predicting the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pretty Girls were important, but Neptune members\u2019 image was also important. Since we decided to roll up our sleeves and work together, our goal was to increase each member\u2019s image in a positive light as best we could.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune is already popular, so it\u2019s important we decided how we proceed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung suddenly called a production assistant over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was Neptune when you met them in person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male production assistant gave her two thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, besides that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The production assistant glanced at me, so I nodded at him with a smile. I was indicating that he didn\u2019t need to feel any pressure, but he seemed to feel even more pressure. Anyways, it seemed he was more scared of Producer Yoo Sooyoung than me, so he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like they are aware of the viewers\u2019 reactions so it seems they are holding back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding back?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, since Neptune is already popular unlike Pretty Girls, it\u2019s normal for them to worry about their image. They can\u2019t help but be cautious. Only Im Seoyoung looked like a fish in water? She didn\u2019t seem to be overly concerned by the cameras and acted very naturally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says. What about you, Chief Jung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. In my eyes, the girls seem to be acting like normal, and it seems that Seoyoung is overly aware of the cameras.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung seemed to ponder over something at my words as she rubbed her chin.</p><br/><p>Then she asked the production assistant,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think of when I say \u2018Lee Taehee\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, singer-songwriter. She makes her own songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Lee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredibly beautiful. A divine actress. Uh, an acting genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about LJ/\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoxing. There was a scene where she sparred on Good Friends. She looked like a complete pro.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Im Seoyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Breasts?\u201d</p><br/><p>The production assistant read my expression as he said in a drawling voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t really have an interest in girl groups\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>We used social media, interviews, among others to try to showcase each member\u2019s distinct character, but maybe their fandom was the only one that was aware of that. So their public image had only reached this level.</p><br/><p>Still, wasn\u2019t \u2018breasts\u2019 a little too severe?</p><br/><p>I stared at him, and he crumbled up even more.</p><br/><p>I told Producer Yoo Sooyoung, who asked me for my opinion,</p><br/><p>\u201cI may be biased, but there are a ton more to them than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll see it. All of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>From that day on, cameras were installed in Neptune\u2019s residence. Of course, they were even set up in my minivan.</p><br/><p>Then, a few days later, the production assistant, having checked the footage, quietly came up to me and confessed that he bought Neptune\u2019s album with his own money and asked for their autographs.</p><br/><p>Footage continued to pile up every day.</p><br/><p>The program\u2019s title was also set, \u2018Making Film\u2019 or \u2018Ma-Fil\u2019<sup>{3}</sup> for short.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the PR Team regularly fueling reporters, the public\u2019s interest of Making Film didn\u2019t cool and instead burned steadily. The internal team acted quickly while Producer Yoo Sooyoung and the production staff worked.</p><br/><p>Things progressed smoothly like we were flying on a tailwind.</p><br/><p>Then, as we were beginning to focus on the recording and choreography of Pretty Girls\u2019 single\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to decide. We can\u2019t keep waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung started the conversation.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the meeting room nodded as they looked at Chief Lee Taeshin.</p><br/><p>We still hadn\u2019t heard from Jung Jae. Chief Lee Taeshin and a cameraman looked around everywhere for her, but it was all for nothing. She only called her parents to tell them not to worry, so they didn\u2019t even know where she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t know when it has become such a big topic. She must know that Chief Lee has been searching for her as well. Seeing as she\u2019s been quiet all this time, it seems she has no plans on appearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe past members, who were they? Yoon Bora and Park Hyojin? You said they called to support them? Why don\u2019t we settle their relationship on good terms and give up on Jung Jae? Won\u2019t we mess up this good mood if we forcefully bring a girl who doesn\u2019t want to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Jae\u2019s future I saw and the short call I had with her stuck to my throat like a bone, but I was also thinking the same thing.</p><br/><p>We mentioned that Pretty Girls were a four-member team when we made a press release, and Jung Jae was still considered a member on their profiles. Seeing as she still hasn\u2019t contacted us, it seemed like she had no thoughts of joining us like Team Leader Park suggested.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t have time to wait any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung asked as she turned to look at me.</p><br/><p>The moment I opened my mouth to answer, my vision went dark.</p><br/><p>Was this the future?</p><br/><p>My vision was dark. It was late in the night.</p><br/><p>My insides were churning. I felt like I was about to throw up.</p><br/><p>I was sitting in the passenger seat of a familiar van. Heavy rain fell on the windshield. The wipers moved nonstop but the road quickly became blurry. Static faintly filled my vision around it.</p><br/><p>The van was quickly driving through the rain. I couldn\u2019t tell where I was and where I was going.</p><br/><p>My eyes were fixed on a phone rather than the window.</p><br/><p>DMB?<sup>{4}</sup> A video was playing on the screen. Ah, this. It was a program that reported on provocative celebrity news. It seemed like the reporter was narrating something, but I couldn\u2019t hear it properly. Instead, subtitles appeared on the screen with a clip and audio recording.</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora (20) / Former Pretty Girls member</p><br/><p>I heard that our unni went to a drinking party with investors. I was scared and terrified that they would make us do something like that too. I could endure any hardship and was desperate for success, but I didn\u2019t want to do that. That\u2019s why I left.</p><br/><p>What the heck was this nonsense?</p><br/><p>She said this on a broadcast? While mentioning another member and a drinking party?</p><br/><p>A new scene played on the screen.</p><br/><p>Internet articles painting Yoon Bora and Park Hyojin as victims and the netizens\u2019 uproar. They framed the three members, who were still-high schoolers, as shrewd women and even insinuated that some sort of exchange occurred for me to choose Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>Then W&amp;U\u2019s rebuttal and NK\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>What a shit show.</p><br/><p>If Yoon Bora and Park Hyojin were planning on gaining the public\u2019s sympathy to spread their name, then it was a success.</p><br/><p>Though, I wouldn\u2019t let this happen for real.</p><br/><p>I was wracking my brain when a profile picture suddenly appeared. Although her face was blurred, I could instantly tell. It was Jung Jae.</p><br/><p>Then the netizens\u2019 comments rushed in the chat.</p><br/><p>-I found the Pretty Girls member who went to those drinking parties.</p><br/><p>-Hot damn, her body\u2019s amazing. I bet she slept with those investors?</p><br/><p>-I bet both my cheeks that she slept with them. There\u2019s no doubt. She even looks very risque.</p><br/><p>-How much would you have to pay to sleep with a woman like her?</p><br/><p>-Why did a girl who attended these things not land a single commercial? Were her skills in bed that bad?</p><br/><p>Oh my god.</p><br/><p>Jung Jae was done for in this situation. Not just as a celebrity, this would follow her around her entire life.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, we arrived\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard Lee Kwanwoo\u2019s voice from the driver\u2019s seat. The van had stopped at some point.</p><br/><p>My future self turned the phone off. Then I looked up.</p><br/><p>A hospital? Why was I at a hospital?</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this.</p><br/><p>Something forcefully hit the van\u2019s window. It wasn\u2019t the rain. It was a hand. A man wearing a poncho was banging the window. With that as a start, dozens of reporters rushed to the van. They pointed their mics and cameras at us.</p><br/><p>Cameras flashed like lightning in the dark.</p><br/><p>Someone shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Jung Sunwoo! Do you think that you arepartly responsible for Ms. Jung Jae\u2019s suicide?!\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Chungmuro \u2013 mentioned before for its film festival</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> It\u2019ll be good no matter how they edit it.</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> The actual name in the raws is \u2018Making Film\u2019. In Korean, the shortened name would be pronounced more like \u2018MayPil\u2019. I will mainly be using the full name.</p><br/><p><sup>{4}</sup> DMB\u2013 Digital Multimedia Broadcasting</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-158\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 158\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-160\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 160\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201430\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

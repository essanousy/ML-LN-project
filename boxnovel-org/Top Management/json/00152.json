I\u2019m still your manager, and Pretty Girls have their own manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the project?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung asked in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>I was momentarily at a loss for words at their unexpected reactions. Instead of replying, I just nodded. This time, LJ said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk while eating. The food\u2019s going to go cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Open the pizza box first! We need to eat it while it warm because we added a ton of extra cheese!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls moved quickly. LJ opened and set the food and snacks I bought on the table, and Lee Taehee filled glasses with various drinks. Im Seoyoung divided the tasty pizza for everyone.</p><br/><p>What was this reaction?</p><br/><p>I had thought that they would call me a traitor like when they mistakenly thought I was being assigned to Son Chaeyoung or hit the ground like citizens who lost their country, but it felt odd that they seemed completely fine.</p><br/><p>I stood, unable to adjust to the situation when Lee Songha approached me.</p><br/><p>I became tense again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have potato and bulgogi<sup>{1}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha showed me the two pizza slices in her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought over the biggest slices. Which one would you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, just give me whatever\u2026 But do you have nothing you want to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Or want to throw at me?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stared at me. Opening her lips, which had no makeup on, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish it goes well. Your project.\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled slightly as she nodded.</p><br/><p>I felt like I had swallowed a stone.</p><br/><p>The other girls\u2019 reactions made me confused, but I became even more confused after seeing Lee Songha\u2019s reaction. Lee Songha\u2019s reaction had always been the same, whether Son Chaeyoung asked me to be her manager or I told her I wanted to work with Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>It felt like the girl who always stuck next to me had taken a step away.</p><br/><p>This change was shocking\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for you, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s only temporary now, if this project is a success, you might really become a team leader. I really hope you do. It\u2019s fine so long as you don\u2019t change who you\u2019re assigned to. If you get promoted, then I\u2019ll just work that much harder to become successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then started working her way through the pizza. Half the pizza instantly disappeared in her mouth. After her cheeks were stuffed like a squirrel saving food for the winter, she began talking again,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as I become famous and important enough for a team leader to personally take care and go around with me. Then we can continue to work together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was muffled due to the food in her cheeks, but her every word rang clearly in my ears like bells. How could she say such words with no change to her expression?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked at me again. Then she became surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I ate both slices. When did I eat them both? There\u2019ll probably be some left!\u201d</p><br/><p>She brushed off the crumbs from her now empty hands and quickly rushed over to the table. Then she grabbed one of the remaining slices and waved it at me. She even gestured at me to come over.</p><br/><p>I shook my head. Her words, which echoed in my head like bells, dispersed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was sort of expecting this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee said while handing me a glass of alcohol when I sat down next to Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung hugged her knees and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re becoming more and more famous by the day, and everything you do is a huge success. You can\u2019t stay with us forever. We were thinking that a day like this would arrive. It came much faster than we expected, and it\u2019s surprising that it\u2019s for another girl group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still worth celebrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ added. Im Seoyoung made a fuss about how we needed to toast and raised her glass. Five glasses clinked in the air.</p><br/><p>I downed my glass in one go. I drank the cold beer with ice, yet heat spread out from my throat to my belly.</p><br/><p>They had been expecting this.</p><br/><p>So that was what they were thinking when I was focused on other things.</p><br/><p>Maybe I should have brought it up earlier since I would be working with another girl group even if I wasn\u2019t going to be their personal manager. This must feel different than when I started working with Nam Joyoon. It wouldn\u2019t be weird if they were disappointed, yet they didn\u2019t show such emotions on their faces.</p><br/><p>I looked at them and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cEven in the future, to me, you girls are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuahh, don\u2019t say it! Just stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was going to say something serious, yet Im Seoyoung shouted while covering her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even say what I wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019To me, you girls are first\u2019, \u2018to me, you are the best\u2019. You were going to say something like that, weren\u2019t you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make me cry even if you made an old eighties gag! I\u2019m holding it back! If you say something like that, this party\u2019s going to be ruined with everyone crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on crying though?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said before adding,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who might cry all night out of the four of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, then I\u2019m going to the washroom so finish it off before I come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung got up and ran to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Dumbfounded, I laughed. The girls started giggling too. As expected, with Im Seoyoung, any serious mood would soften up. She needed show this side of her on entertainment shows.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I received the chicken thigh Lee Songha passed me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why is it Pretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ changed the mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of that member who asked for your business card? Jung Jae or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>My cheeks stung. I knew who was staring at me without looking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. She has semi-left the group, so we don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll come back or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The piercing stare softened.</p><br/><p>LJ, who was looking at me with narrowed eyes, tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I see wrong? Her eyes didn\u2019t seem normal, so I thought she would definitely contact you. Your gaze also lingered on her that day. So I thought you were producing the album for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her quick senses were almost at the level of being a superpower.</p><br/><p>I explained Pretty Girls\u2019 unfortunate situation.</p><br/><p>Then I said to Lee Taehee, who was blowing on the lip of a bottle by herself,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this is a project producing Pretty Girls\u2019 single album, it\u2019ll also benefit your next album as well. So please trust me and wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Smiling faintly, Lee Taehee nodded.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>My mind was dizzy from the tapping noise.</p><br/><p>When I checked what it was, it was my finger tapping on the table. I clenched a fist and looked beside me. Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader were concentrating while sharing a pair of earphones.</p><br/><p>They were focused on Lee Taehee\u2019s first song.</p><br/><p>The song went by in a flash when I listened to it, but now these four minutes seemed like four hours. I licked my dry lips. I was parched. I wanted to pour some warm coffee down my throat, but the coffee cup in my hand was empty long ago.</p><br/><p>The first song finally ended.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader took his earphone out and whispered something to Kim Hyunjo. His expression wasn\u2019t very bright.</p><br/><p>Did he not like it?</p><br/><p>When I listened to it, although it has been proven that my ears were crap, I thought that it definitely wasn\u2019t a bad song. I thought it was of similar quality to the Pretty Girls\u2019 song.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that there were two more songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader asked while scratching his sideburns.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk after listening to them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like my insides were being crushed.</p><br/><p>I played the remaining two songs. Their expressions didn\u2019t change. I comforted myself when I saw them nod their head or tap their feet.</p><br/><p>It was finally over by the time I crumbled my coffee cup.</p><br/><p>The two began whispering to each other again. My patience was being burned to its wick.</p><br/><p>In the end, I couldn\u2019t endure it any longer and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow were they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Taehee have any other songs than these?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo asked with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the only ones that are complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? I asked just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sigh was mixed in with his answer.</p><br/><p>My frozen mind began to churn.</p><br/><p>If they both found the three songs to be lacking, then the A&amp;R Team\u2019s opinion wouldn\u2019t be too different from them. That would be the worst. I had thought that at least one of Lee Taehee\u2019s songs would get a good reaction considering she put her heart into making them.</p><br/><p>Was there a better song among the ones they\u2019ve already collected?</p><br/><p>Also, if that was the case, then Pretty Girls\u2019 single\u2026</p><br/><p>If I played that song for them in this dreary situation where none of the songs played were worthy of being title tracks\u2026 And if Kim Hyunjo, the Team 3 Leader, and other employees thought that the song would be a hit if Neptune sang it like in my future\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, they would want to give that song to Neptune and give Pretty Girls a different one. Even if we decided to work on the project, Neptune\u2019s next album would obviously be more important to the company.</p><br/><p>It was the same for me.</p><br/><p>Another storm began brewing once I finally relaxed my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader groaned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyunjo, you listened to all the songs we collected until now, right? Were there any good ones?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did pick a few, but they weren\u2019t good enough to be title tracks. As just another song in the album, well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one should we pick as the title track? I liked the first one?\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second one for me. I think that one suited Neptune better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe could go with double title tracks like before. We need to think hard about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their conversation became strange mid-way.</p><br/><p>I gave the two of them a blank look when the Team 3 Leader chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a picture of Lucky Charm, no, Team Leader Jung. It\u2019s my first time seeing him make that expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? His spirits pierced the sky when he said he wanted to release an unknown girl group\u2019s album, yet did he also age when he became a team leader? Why are you acting like an old man? Stop being so wishy-washy. It\u2019s better if your spirits are high even if you do something absurd.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said while laughing. He then slapped my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, they\u2019re good. Why are you so nervous when bringing such good songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>My tense shoulders finally relaxed.</p><br/><p>These guys\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you surprised?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s jokes like this that can kill.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said as I brushed my front hair aside. Oh my god. I was so nervous for the past fifteen minutes that my forehead was soaked in sweat. Exhausted, I rested my back on the chair and asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre all three songs good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are better than Satellite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo immediately replied. His voice was filled with excitement and certainty.</p><br/><p>He tapped the table and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first song was so catchy that I thought, \u2018This is the one.\u2019 Then when I heard the second song, I thought, \u2018No, this is the one.\u2019 That was the same for the third.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaehee really is talented. She must have been under a lot of pressure because her first two songs were hits, but she keeps making songs like this. I bet it\u2019ll be fun making their next album with songs like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>So drunk Song Inho\u2019s impressions were correct.</p><br/><p>If I knew their reactions would be so good, I would have played the songs right away. I just wasted time worrying about it by myself.</p><br/><p>I felt good when I thought about giving Lee Taehee the good news.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader chuckled as he added,</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm, if your plan works, then maybe this will be an even greater hit than their mini-album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plan.</p><br/><p>If in the future I had yet to see, the album with Lee Taehee\u2019s song wasn\u2019t a hit, I believed that it was because of bad luck or timing or a lack of mass appeal.</p><br/><p>And those were things I could do something about.</p><br/><p>I planned on increasing the press and public\u2019s interest to their peak with the success of Pretty Girls\u2019 reality TV show and single before releasing Neptune\u2019s next album. So that they could make a comeback with so much of the public\u2019s interest that we wouldn\u2019t even have to promote their album.</p><br/><p>I would make that happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut does Pretty Girls not have a song?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that an unknown songwriter made it. Do you not have it here? I\u2019m curious about that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Various thoughts crossed my mind in a brief moment.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t it be okay? They really liked Lee Taehee\u2019s song, and there was a massive benefit to having Lee Taehee\u2019s own songs. Also, she had three songs to boot. So\u2026</p><br/><p>I swallowed dryly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have it.\u201d</p><br/><p>They put on their earphones again.</p><br/><p>I played the guide version, which I had listened to a countless number of times.</p><br/><p>Then I observed their expressions, especially Kim Hyunjo\u2019s.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Popular marinated meat dish in Korea</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-151\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 151\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-153\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 153\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201416\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

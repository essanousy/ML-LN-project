I guessed when we went for drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a representative of a Chinese agency company. I recalled his neat and urban face. His voice in which he proposed I leave W&amp;U and go independent with Chinese investments.</p><br/><p>I curtly replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat happened a year ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI refused his proposal then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back, I didn\u2019t regret my decision. I didn\u2019t plan on leaving W&amp;U any time soon, and the foresight I had seen at the time made me uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Whenever I met Lee Lyang on business trips to China, he would bring the proposal up in the passing, but talks never progressed. He even stopped mentioning it recently. This was something I had tossed in the corner of my mind until recently.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader rubbed his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO has never brought up any talks about investments, has he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s fine. I was going to advise you to save yourself if the CEO happened to know about it. I was worried that sparks would fly to you because the Team 2 Leader created this wreck after accepting Chinese investments. If the CEO doesn\u2019t know, then that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><br/><p>If CEO Baek Hansung doesn\u2019t know\u2026</p><br/><p>Can I say for certain that he doesn\u2019t?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019ve noticed, then the CEO might also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Lee Lyang brought it up only because he was with me. He won\u2019t say a word in front of the CEO. If the CEO knew that such talks were ongoing beneath the surface, he would immediately change the agency we work with.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader waved his hand. Kim Hyunjo, who was listening with a serious expression, joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to tell the CEO that something like this happened and that he refused? It just makes me feel uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. There\u2019s no need to bother the CEO about something that\u2019s already in the past. Especially at a time like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it really isn\u2019t a good time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo scratched his head as he looked up at the ceiling. My phone on the table began to ring. I flinched when I saw the caller. The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo flinched in shock at the same time.</p><br/><p>It was CEO Baek Hansung. What kind of timing was this?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I heard that you\u2019ve arrived.</p><br/><p>He spoke slowly. It was difficult to gauge his mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I arrived not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Shall we meet?</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Hmm, I do have something I want to ask.</p><br/><p>What would it be? That he would want to ask?</p><br/><p>Was it about the Team 2 Leader? I probably had a lot to do with him suddenly deciding to go independent.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s about the Chinese investment matter?</p><br/><p>That bothered me too because of what the Team 3 Leader said.</p><br/><p>Even as I opened the door to the CEO\u2019s office, my mind was a tangled mess trying to figure out what the CEO\u2019s motives were.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung was standing alone in front of a wall. The wall was full of profile pictures of celebrities at W&amp;U. CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s finger lightly brushed past them. Neptune, Lee Songha, Nam Joyoon, Pretty Girls, and even the actors the Team 2 Leader was in charge of managing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Sit. You must be exhausted after coming back from your business trip to China.\u201d</p><br/><p>My shoulders reflexively stiffened when he mentioned China.</p><br/><p>When I sat at an empty seat, CEO Baek Hansung came over. After experiencing some unexpected misfortune during the weekend and with the Team 2 Leader causing a ruckus, I had expected him to be different from normal.</p><br/><p>Although I couldn\u2019t imagine CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s red face spouting curses as he jumped up and down, I at least thought his mood would be fiercer. He was the same as normal. What was he thinking behind his calm face?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a project titled \u2018Telepathy\u2019 amongst the scenarios, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmongst the projects brought to Lee Songha. The one with Director Cha Jaeho and Heo Kakyung as the lead. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I did.</p><br/><p>I churned my mind, going through my memories to keep up with this sudden topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a project we rejected because female lead\u2019s role didn\u2019t suit Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>I remember that I had discussed it with CEO Baek Hansung and the director before making a final decision to reject it.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung was smiling when I gave him a puzzled look.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a project you are thinking about for Lee Songha\u2019s next project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a few decent ones, but we are looking through them with an open mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I actually owe Director Cha Jaeho a favor from a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation was taking an unexpected direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI met Director Cha because he said he wanted to have a meal, but it seems like he\u2019s really interested in Lee Songha. He even said that they were willing to adjust a significant portion of the female lead\u2019s character if she agrees to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mind jolted awake. The matters regarding the Team 2 Leader and Chinese investments were completely swept from my mind.</p><br/><p>Was he saying he wanted us to go with that project for Lee Songha?</p><br/><p>I quickly recalled the scenario and female lead. The scenario was fine. It was a well-structured action thriller. I had considered this project for a good while because Heo Kakyung, famous for his box-office appeal, had already signed on it. However, this wasn\u2019t a project where the female lead shined.</p><br/><p>The female lead was simply someone with a pretty face and body who was the male lead\u2019s love interest. Even if it was a box-office success, all the attention would be focused on Heo Kakyung. How much would that character change through adjustments? It left a bitter taste in my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any projects you are seriously considering, why not listen to them once more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if the talks do not go well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately raised my head. CEO Baek Hansung calmly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cA favor is a favor, but if there\u2019s a better project, then, of course, we should do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re at the wrong party.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung looked around with an awkward expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the wrong party. Since it\u2019s the closing ceremony at a short film festival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like a lot of people are looking at us. Like, \u2018why are they here?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess they are fascinated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since this was a film event, most attendees were directors and production-related professions as well as actors. It was obvious that a girl group would stand out.</p><br/><p>They were also dressed up since it has been a while since they last posed in front of a photo wall. The short film festival\u2019s photo wall was plain compared to the red carpets of international film festivals. Throwing Neptune into the mix, they stood out like flamingos in a dance of cranes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are cameras everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ suddenly wedged herself between Lee Songha and me. Being pushed aside, Lee Songha frowned. LJ lightly shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had a scandal, so we need to be careful of any two-shots of you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, keep apart from each other. In the wrong hands, a two-shot could become a love shot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung joined in to support LJ. Lee Songha was pushed back two more steps. Her clear face was now starting to cloud over. Lee Taehee, who was swaggering behind us like she was taking a walk, comforted Lee Songha by patting her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Park Hweseung! Right, right? Oppa, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung stomped her feet when she saw the actor in front of the photo wall. I unwittingly laughed because it had been a while since I saw her act like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, our eyes met! He\u2019s coming over. What do I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>She fussed all on her own before becoming serious as she looked at her fellow members.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make a fuss just because we\u2019re in front of a movie actor. Let\u2019s pass by while greeting him in a natural way. So that it\u2019s not embarrassing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the only one causing a fuss. Is this your first time seeing a movie actor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung shook her head at LJ\u2019s rebuke. Park Hweseung was like the celebrity of celebrities. He was an actor who barely made any appearances on TV and entertainment shows and was wholly focused on his acting career. It was difficult to see him outside of a film festival like this.</p><br/><p>To be honest, my desire to ask for an autograph surged up my throat.</p><br/><p>Park Hweseung walked up to us. His unkempt beard and unrefined appearance gave us the aura of a talented actor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello!\u201d</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t have time to cause a fuss because we were next in front of the photo wall. We had a simple handshake before going our separate ways when I heard Park Hweseung talk with his manager from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I got to shake hands with a girl group. Aren\u2019t you jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m soo jealous. Sell me your palm.\u201d</p><br/><p>That moment, Im Seoyoung\u2019s eyes popped with stars. She urgently shook my clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, oppa, did you hear that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re popular with movie actors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably popular amongst middle-aged men.\u201d</p><br/><p>I chuckled as I sent the girls off in front of the cameras. The photo wall was instantly overwhelmed with camera flashes. Their reactions were not much different from Park Hweseung. People gathered around to see the girls as they were changing their poses according to the reporters\u2019 requests.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you Team Leader Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man came over in a friendly manner. His face looked familiar, but who was he? I looked through my memories and barely managed to remember. He was a production employee I had met at some ceremony. He glanced at the photo wall before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of Neptune came?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Songha is here as a presenter, they asked Neptune to perform.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I came over to find any good rookie directors\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee glanced behind him. The people who had been following him like ducklings had been staring at me for a while. Having gathered their gazes once more, the production employee grabbed my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, say hello. You all know him, right? He\u2019s Team Leader Jung Sunwoo of W&amp;U.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes glistened. The employee introduced them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the director and actors who submitted their project to a competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder. Their appearances were excessively neat for them to be production company employees. I shook their hands with a smiling face. I took special care in observing the director. While he was a rookie director who hasn\u2019t debuted yet, he could be next year\u2019s rising star.</p><br/><p>Once the girls got out of the photo wall, we were introduced to and introduced ourselves endlessly. There were directors and actors, who were the main show tonight, as well as production and distribution company employees. There were even famous directors here to judge.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s so good-looking. Particularly Ms. Im Seoyoung, you have a face meant for acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were even directors selling snake oil.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? My face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re a singer, but your vocalization and expressions are good. You should act!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? There\u2019s no way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, having watched the scene that branded Im Seoyoung as an iconic figure for terrible acting, the director asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Lee Taehee, are you not interested in acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Neptune was laughing and chatting, I mixed in with the directors and production companies.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Director Jang Joonmo and Mr. Hweseung will be attending the afterparty. How about you, Team Leader Jung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, of course, we will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since all important discussions would happen there.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Ms. Son Chaeyoung will be doing a drama? She should do a movie. I have a decent project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Seo Jijoon seems quiet these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard rumors that you were gathered a ton of scenarios and proposals. Did you find any decent projects?\u201d</p><br/><p>I always felt this, but rumors traveled quickly in this industry. It seemed like those who asked me about Seo Jijoon and Son Chaeyoung already knew about the incident with the Team 2 Leader. Their eyes stuck to me even more than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the rumor about Ms. Lee Songha joining Telepath?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTelepathy? Director Chae\u2019s project? She\u2019s joining that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>I forced my frowning brows straight. Rumors traveled fast, but gossip was even faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been decided. We are still examining it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? The investment distribution company was thinking that it was already decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess there was some miscommunication.\u201d</p><br/><p>Or they purposely leaked that information. I guess I should set the meeting earlier. I\u2019ll listen to them, but if it isn\u2019t good, I needed to properly refuse this time. CEO Baek Hansung also said to find something better.</p><br/><p>A better project.</p><br/><p>I had now looked through most projects. I was now in the process of re-reading projects in case I missed something. It was now time to decide on a project, but I still couldn\u2019t make a decision.</p><br/><p>Was I expecting something too special? Did I have no choice but to pick one from my final choices?</p><br/><p>The ceremony began while I was still lost in my thoughts. Having finished their performance in front of the movie screen, the girls sat next to me. Winning projects were introduced, and unfamiliar directors and actors were mentioned.</p><br/><p>I was still lost in my thoughts as I clapped mechanically.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon were a given, but Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon needed new projects now. I wanted to get them something good. Since they readily sided with me, I wanted to get them good projects no matter what.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this.</p><br/><p>Static filled my vision.</p><br/><p>And my heart began to beat noisily.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-194\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 194\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-196\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 196\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201504\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Around 2,000 films are submitted to the Cannes Film Festival every year. Around 50 of them were invited for their official selection.</p><br/><p>Only three works in the country were invited to the Cannes International Film Festival.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, none were in the \u2018Competition\u2019, the main event of the festival. The other two films were in the \u2018Out of Competition\u2019 section, while City Jungle was in the \u2018Un Certain Regard\u2019 section.</p><br/><p>One more thing.</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung was nominated for the \u2018Camera d\u2019Or\u2019, which rewards the best first film among debutants.</p><br/><p>Though there were 24 competitors.</p><br/><p>Anyways, this was also why City Jungle became a hot topic again. While it was in the other sections, it was the only one that could potentially win an award. I say it again, but competition really brings out the public\u2019s excitement.</p><br/><p>Reporters and the public were very curious about whether City Jungle will be able to win an award at the film festival. Articles were published constantly without us having to make a press release.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, this makes me feel like a national athlete going to an international competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Forest\u2019s CEO said while rubbing his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the reporters ask about is whether we think we\u2019ll win the \u2018Un Certain Regard\u2019 award or the \u2018Camera d\u2019Or\u2019 award or not. All they ask about are the awards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because only our film was nominated for awards.\u201d</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s project producer said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Although Forest\u2019s CEO, who would be attending Cannes International Film Festival for the first time, looked like he was about to pass out, SBE Film\u2019s people, who had attended the festival a few times before, looked calm.</p><br/><p>As for me, well, it was great that I had a poker face on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about the reporters making a fuss, but don\u2019t get your hopes up on receiving an award. People over there are incredibly stuck-up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer said while looking at Forest\u2019s employees and me.</p><br/><p>While countless Korean films were invited to Cannes over the years, it was still worth celebrating if one was nominated in a competition with 20 or so films. They had never received a \u2018Palme d\u2019Or\u2019 award.<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cWe can still dream, right? How would you feel if you won the best award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. It\u2019s like winning the gold medal in the Olympics!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet we\u2019ll probably receive a prize from the government? I heard they give medals if you receive the \u2018Un Certain Regard\u2019 award?\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of people gathered around started to flush red.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an article saying that Mason Tucker will be attending Cannes International Film Festival!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung clung to my waist as she followed me.</p><br/><p>She was more knowledgeable about who was attending the festival this year than I was.</p><br/><p>\u201cMegan Shanner too! And Aaron Taylor! Mason arrived last night and is staying in the Majestic Hotel. What do I do, oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what do you do\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I go with you? With my money! I\u2019ll use my own money for everything! Just give me a ticket in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop joking and work hard on your radio and TV broadcasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuahh! Mason!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Im Seoyoung was shouting out a Hollywood star\u2019s name, Lee Taehee and LJ were looking through Lee Songha\u2019s luggage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t there a lot of snacks? It\u2019s unlike you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having been thrown over Lee Songha\u2019s shoulder before, LJ gave her a look of suspicion. I also glanced at Lee Songha. I packed the daily necessities and her stylist packed her clothes, so I expected half her luggage to be filled with snacks.</p><br/><p>There was definitely less than normal for Lee Songha. Don\u2019t tell me there was a problem?</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, did you lose your appetite? Do you not crave chips?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said as if telling me not to worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get them over there. There\u2019ll be French snacks in France.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>So like her.</p><br/><p>We left their residence while being sent off by the girls.</p><br/><p>For some reason, our way to Incheon International Airport was surprisingly traffic-free today. The sky was blue, and the breeze that blew in was warm and comfortable. It felt like I was driving in the sky than on asphalt. My heart throbbed just enough to feel good.</p><br/><p>We were going to Cannes.</p><br/><p>The glamorous place full of world-class actors, directors, production companies and agencies. We were going to the place where I hoped I would one day go when I took my first step into the entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that I changed the present on my own, I now had a piece of the future I wanted.</p><br/><p>I heard someone humming. When I looked beside me, Lee Songha was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you excited?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Interesting.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t look all that excited when she swept up all the rookie awards at the broadcasting and film awards at the end of last year. Did Cannes just feel different?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you most excited about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are going to be tons of famous actors from all over the world over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any actors you want to see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Since actors there will be much more famous than me, no one will pay me any interest. Actors who went to Cannes last year said that they wore slippers and leisurely walked around Boulevard de la Croisette. There won\u2019t be anyone who recognizes me there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>While her name was quite known nationally and in China, she was relatively unknown internationally. There wouldn\u2019t be anyone who recognizes her unless they were Korean reporters reporting on Cannes or correspondents there.</p><br/><p>Was she under a lot of stress from her fame?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to go around without anyone recognizing you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCannes apparently has beautiful beaches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha smiled subtly as she gave me an irrelevant answer. Then she took out a book from her handbag. It was a tourist guidebook on Cote d\u2019Azur in Cannes. She seemed to have already gone through it once as there were index stickers sticking out from various pages.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be more interested in sightseeing than the film festival? Did you give up on the award already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, the harbor is full of super luxurious yachts during the festival. Oppa, do you want to go on a yacht?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do, but what\u2019s important is\u2026 What are you writing right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>While questioning Lee Songha, who was smiling wickedly, we arrived at the airport. We went to the airport with the help of security guards and were met with reporters and spectators forming a long line.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo, who was managing the situation, came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave our staff arrived? Where\u2019s Joyoon hyung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey already arrived. He\u2019s with the staff members. Also, we\u2019ve been receiving a lot of requests for an interview before we take off. What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell them that we\u2019ll do a short one. Reporters won\u2019t expect any more than that considering how cluttered things are.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending Lee Kwanwoo off, I went to where the staff were gathering. The staff, which included stylists, makeup and hair artists, were piling up their luggage carriers. Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup were sitting in the middle. When I came over, Nam Joyoon was on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, father. It\u2019s in Cannes. Cannes. Yes, Cannes. No, Cannes. France. Film festival.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup was watching, frustrated, before finally taking over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, this is Hyunsup. We arrived at the airport to board the flight. It\u2019s Cannes. Similar to how to pronounce tin can<sup>{2}</sup>. It\u2019s a city in France, and they hold a film festival every year. It\u2019s the most famous film festival in the world. Joyoon, this guy, has been invited to attend. Of course, this guy\u2019s completely turned around his career.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon shook his head slightly, but Kim Hyunsup began to more in a more dynamic manner,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most famous film festival in the world. Ah, the award\u2026 There\u2019s meaning in just attending this festival. There are a lot of people working in the film industry that dream of being invited here. You can go boast about it all over town. You can even hang a banner at the village hall!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, you might\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon grimaced. Kim Hyunsup seemed to catch his mistake and quietly added,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not tell your wife about the banner.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kim Hyunsup hung up, the staff, who had been suppressing their laughs, finally burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>I asked Nam Joyoon, who took back his phone,</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. This all feels so unreal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon smiled in a slightly bitter manner. Then his gaze alternated between Lee Songha and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha\u2026 You look fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha replied like it was nothing.</p><br/><p>She was extremely fine. Because her mind was elsewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo, how about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your first time going to Cannes too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll have to see the palm trees for it to really sink in.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Lee Songha! It\u2019s your first time attending the Cannes International Festival, how do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s unexpected, so I think I\u2019ll have to see the palm trees for it to really sink in. Thank you very much for supporting us. I\u2019ll go and see, experience, and learn a lot over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo either of you have any promises if you receive the award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCountless movie fans are hoping you return in glory, please give us a comment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though we told them that this would be quick, reporters viciously swarmed at them like starved chickens.</p><br/><p>I checked the time before jumping in.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, we are on a tight schedule so we\u2019ll have to head in now. We plan on holding an official press interview in Cannes, so we can talk in a more relaxed fashion over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut them off and urged my group to move. Reporters pushed onwards, asking us to answer one last question. In the end, the safe line collapsed, and security guards had to hold them back. This sight was familiar since I\u2019ve experienced this multiple times going to and coming from China, but this was on another level.</p><br/><p>This was comparable to how one would send off a national athlete when they went to the Olympics.</p><br/><p>The production staff and Director Oh Hyunkyung left a couple of days ahead of us and we were the second group, It was great that we moved separately. It was this crazy with just us. It would have been even more chaotic if we had the production staff with us.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a safe flight!\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard the reporters cheering us from behind.</p><br/><p>Transferring in Paris, 13 hours had passed when we arrived at Nice Cote d\u2019Azur International Airport. Because there was a 7-hour time difference, the sky was still blue when we arrived at the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be quiet here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup asked as he dragged the luggage carrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably. We don\u2019t know how many reporters arrived ahead of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was exhausting when there were a lot of reporters, but thinking about how there won\u2019t be anyone makes me sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>He licked his lips.</p><br/><p>However, unexpectedly, we encountered a blast of heat as soon as we got out. Foreign reporters holding cameras and spectators who came from all across the world filled the airport. Their excited voices pierced my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Uh, don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re here for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone cut Kim Hyunsup off. When I turned around, it was SBE Film\u2019s project producer.</p><br/><p>He looked at the reporters as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAaron Taylor\u2019s coming on a private jet. They\u2019re gathered here to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, a private jet\u2026 This is actually happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup said in astonishment. The project producer laughed as he led the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe really rich come on their private yachts. Super luxurious yachts that are so big they can\u2019t moor at the harbor. You see them floating around when you go to the beach.\u201d</p><br/><p>We leisurely made our way through the airport. There was no need to rush. Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon were clearly revealing their faces, but there was no one who recognized them. They were all busy trying to see Hollywood stars that they didn\u2019t spare a glance at us.</p><br/><p>This was too drastic of a difference compared to the heated reactions at Incheon Airport. It felt like we would freeze.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there were a few Korean reporters who arrived before us and asked for an interview and some pictures. The staff grinned as they were happy to see them. We left the airport after holding a sufficiently long interview.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Songha and Mr. Joyoon will take the car sent by the film festival.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed to the luxurious cars waiting for them. Kim Hyunsup\u2019s eyes glittered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait here and take the shuttle bus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a joke. We\u2019ll follow them in the car the production company prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff, who were barely managing to stand tall after the 13-hour flight, almost flopped down when they heard about the shuttle bus, only regaining their strength after hearing it was a joke. The project producer made a strange smile. After Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon got in the car did he quietly talk to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung, it\u2019s your first time attending Cannes, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a complete class system here. They discriminate against you according to your \u2018level\u2019. They give you ID cards depending on your \u2018level\u2019. They prepare accommodations and plan tickets according to your \u2018level\u2019. Your \u2018level\u2019 also decides how many screenings and which parties you can attend. And our \u2018level\u2019 isn\u2019t very high.\u201d</p><br/><p>He grabbed my shoulder and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be best if you prepare yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> This chapter came out before Parasite by Director Bong Joon-Ho received the 2019 Palme d\u2019Or award.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> The Korean example in the raws is closer to the actual pronunciation of Cannes than this. I just tried to find a quick replacement. If you know a better example, please let me know.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-215\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 215\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-217\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 217\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201526\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

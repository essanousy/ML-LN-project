You said you aren\u2019t going to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to ask thrice in situations like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she think she was Zhuge Liang<sup>{1}</sup>?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to compare her to the quadruplets, I really didn\u2019t want to compare her to them, but she was worse than when they were preschoolers. A five-year-old that surpassed the \u2018naughty fours\u2019<sup>{2}</sup>, making me want to give her a beating.</p><br/><p>Still, at least they were young and cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I ask you to do something you don\u2019t want to do three times? Why should I waste my time like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone does it like that! Not just thrice, they even ask 30, even 300 times!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I could change my mind by the time you ask me a third time.\u201d</p><br/><p>I say this again, but she really is a crazy bitch.</p><br/><p>I was the one who drank tonight, but why was she the one who seemed drunk?</p><br/><p>What did she want from me? Did she want me to cling to her with tears in my eyes, begging her to make a cameo appearance? Was she doing this to see me like that?</p><br/><p>Perhaps she thought that this was how I should act since people had always begged to get her to accept their requests, but she thought wrong. This cameo appearance wasn\u2019t that important to me.</p><br/><p>Even if it was important, my answer might have been the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on asking you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019d be different it was someone else, but I don\u2019t want to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung glared at me in chilling silence.</p><br/><p>I could see her clench her slender jaw, which looked like it could fit in one hand.</p><br/><p>Would she try to hit me like before?</p><br/><p>Yeah, I was exhausted from being wary of her all day. If she was going to explode, sooner was better than later. I was thinking about how I should protect my own cheek as Lee Songha wasn\u2019t here to take my side and throw a cake.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine then. Let\u2019s talk about something else instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>She unclenched her jaw and her expression calmed.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung nonchalantly suggested we talk about something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk? Us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say to me? Last time-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut her off.</p><br/><p>Why did she want to talk when our relationship would only get worse the more we talked?</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s voice poured out into the quiet, chilly hallway.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy project, my commercial, she took her share from me! Did I grab her hair because of that? I didn\u2019t do anything to her. Then, since she took her share, aren\u2019t we even-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s assume we are even.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we are going to talk, shouldn\u2019t it start with an apology?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn apology?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like what happened didn\u2019t happen all of a sudden. Because of you, Songha could have-\u201c</p><br/><p>As soon as I mentioned Lee Songha\u2019s name, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s eyes flashed fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do to her? I don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared into Son Chaeyoung\u2019s eyes before turning my gaze.</p><br/><p>What did I hope to get from still talking to her?</p><br/><p>I sighed. Just then, I saw someone standing in front of the elevator behind Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>At first, I thought it was Lee Songha, but it wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>It was Seo Eunkyo.</p><br/><p>She was leaning against the wall with the elevator buttons and staring directly at Son Chaeyoung and me. She had a wine bottle in her hand.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung followed my gaze and frowned when she saw Seo Eunkyo. It seemed she had no thoughts of arguing with me in front of others as she walked towards Seo Eunkyo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunbae. I came because I wanted to have a glass of wine with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo stuck to Son Chaeyoung like a flea.</p><br/><p>She looked like she already had a few drinks as her high heels swayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to get close to you and also have some things I want to ask you about. If you have time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said without even looking at Seo Eunkyo.</p><br/><p>Seeing Seo Eunkyo lick her lips, I turned around and went to my room.</p><br/><p>I needed to sleep early since tomorrow would be the start of my merciless schedule. My body was tired from drinking, but my mind was also exhausted thanks to Son Chaeyoung. I really wanted to bury myself in the king-size hotel mattress.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you see someone, you should greet them. The manager and the celebrity are the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was today some special occasion?</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s Cancer horoscope must be this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Beware of crazy bitches.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you don\u2019t have a good relationship with Son Chaeyoung sunbae? You both raised your voices and stuff? It also seemed like she didn\u2019t have a great relationship with Lee Songha, right? Of course, Lee Songha isn\u2019t the type to be adored by sunbaes like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo, who had come up to my nose, said while smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>Her eyes, which were drooped like she had a few drinks, was overflowing with malice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha, that girl, did she sleep with someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe suddenly got commercials and dramas, big ones at that, when she\u2019s just a rookie who had one successful drama. It doesn\u2019t make sense if there isn\u2019t anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything of the sort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she didn\u2019t? I can tell just by seeing the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her quietly whispering voice dirtied my ears.</p><br/><p>My throat heated up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Ms. Seo Eunkyo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s supporting her without hesitation, did she sleep with him? Or, since you had a scandal with her, did she sleep with you too? Wow, so young yet hard working.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say pigs only see pigs. Is that how you work?\u201d</p><br/><p>I scowled, and Seo Eunkyo flinched in fright.</p><br/><p>Then, twice as angry as before, she shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What did you just call me? Pig?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d <sup>{3}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you. Because people treat the two of you like stars, do you really think you are one? You acted like you were so close to the director and writer last time too. If your celebrity is as stiff as a block of wood, then you should be the one bowing for her, yet you\u2019re worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>She poked me with the tip of the wine bottle.</p><br/><p>My mind when blank. How long had it been since I was so angry?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you should know your place. You\u2019re just a manage-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Hit on the back of her head, Seo Eunkyo fell towards me. She took a few teetering steps back before collapsing on the hallway floor like a puppet whose strings were cut.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she a crazy bitch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung tapped Seo Eunkyo\u2019s side with her toe.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even react. Was she dead?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talked back to me so well, yet why were you just taking it from her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung asked while staring at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to talk with me, but I guess you wanted to talk with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was about to do something, but before that, just what-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI hit her, why? Are you going to say something again?\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I might have hit her as well.</p><br/><p>When I examined her, she was breathing well and seemed fine considering she was mumbling something.</p><br/><p>But what did I have to do to make this a perfect crime?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much of a pushover were you for someone like her to tell you to bow or not? You\u2019d be dead if you were my manager right now. No, there wouldn\u2019t even be cases like this from the first place. Are you listening to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t listening to me! What are you thinking about?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow to handle this trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy handle it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung took out her phone and called someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall the security. This person, what\u2019s her name, anyways, is drunk and wasted on the seventh-floor hallway.\u201d</p><br/><p>She hung up after saying what she had to say then looked up at me with her arms crossed.</p><br/><p>Then, with a grim voice, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to say this before, but you did wrong to me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lied to me! When you called and I asked where you were, you said that the team leader didn\u2019t make you call me or that he wasn\u2019t next to you, but you had me on speakerphone with a bunch of people listening in! I didn\u2019t even know that and I-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung cut herself off and suddenly shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should apologize to me too!\u201d</p><br/><p>That did happen.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung didn\u2019t even wait for my reply and turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy am I doing this?! So annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she walked off.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>{\u2018Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019 Lee Songha\u2019s arrival paralyzed a Chinese airport?}</p><br/><p>{Lee Songha\u2019s set to be an international star of the next generation, received a green light for activities in China}</p><br/><p>{Cat Guardian Ghost begins broadcasting, video site accumulated over 50 million views!}</p><br/><p>{Jung Sunwoo, the Midas\u2019s Hand who made Lee Songha an international star, how far will his impact go?}</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, I saw the articles you sent me. They are all good, but what\u2019s the last one?\u201d</p><br/><p>-What do you mean? It\u2019s a hot topic in Korea right now and you became a hot topic along with it.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park laughed refreshingly on the other end.</p><br/><p>I heard the PR Team wasn\u2019t able to leave and have been holding consecutive meetings for the past few days. Maybe it was because it was all good news, but there was delighted clamoring in the background.</p><br/><p>-Due to Park Dojin and Sung Dowon\u2019s scandals breaking out one after another, Chinese investments wavered, and a lot of people in our industry was worried about it. Worried that the popularity of Korean culture would falter as well. But the mood\u2019s flipped now that Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s a hit. The company is celebrating right now too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know how much of a commotion it\u2019s causing in Korea, it can\u2019t compare to here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, I glanced at the promotion event.</p><br/><p>There were the lead and supporting actors including Lee Songha and Seo Jijoon and Director Shin Taekyun and Writer Hong Jumi, who I saw for the first time in a while. The key individuals who created Cat Guardian Ghost were replying to interview questions on the brilliant lights.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked astounded. Though, they couldn\u2019t help but be.</p><br/><p>This was an event originally scheduled to host reporters and around a hundred fans, but they suddenly changed the location and made it ten times bigger. Apparently, fans bugged the crap out of the host, Huai TV, for this, asking them when they would see the actors in person if not now.</p><br/><p>The result was around a thousand fans filling the seats.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lee Songha held the mic.</p><br/><p>Cheers erupted. When Lee Songha began speaking fluent Chinese prepared ahead of time to promote the drama, the fans went crazy. Although I had been to tons of events back home, I had never been to one with such a passionate atmosphere.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was this passionate when we went to perform for the army.</p><br/><p>-Really? The reactions in China are that amazing?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you hear the fans screaming? It\u2019s crazy. We\u2019ve been surrounded by security since arriving in Beijing that we\u2019ve only gone back and forth between locations. We can\u2019t go outside because of the number of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Oh my god. It\u2019s not just Jijoon but Songha as well?</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park asked again and again as if she couldn\u2019t believe the situation.</p><br/><p>I was the same.</p><br/><p>It was so severe that I couldn\u2019t sleep even while lying completely exhausted on the hotel bed.</p><br/><p>My chest strangely felt overwhelmed, and my hands and feet felt so itchy I kept pacing back and forth in my room while looking at Beijing\u2019s glittering nightlife outside my window until dawn.</p><br/><p>I looked at Lee Songha, who was standing on the stage.</p><br/><p>Although I could tell she was a little excited, she looked quite bold.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Songha\u2019s also been receiving a lot of positive reactions. It\u2019s crazy here.\u201d</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s a spree of happy events!</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to that, Neptune\u2019s popularity has risen and it seems their album is selling quite a bit. That\u2019s why Chief Kim is busy adjusting their fan meeting event.\u201d</p><br/><p>-If Neptune does well in China, then we\u2019re extremely fortunate this year! First, we need to use this hype to fix Jijoon and Songha as international stars. Send me all the sources you read and hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll ask the press.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Get your hopes up. I\u2019ll make it so you think, \u2018Ah, so this is what you call returning home in glory,\u2019 when you arrive at Incheon Airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m from MMTV, while you\u2019re staying in Beijing, we wanted to invite Ms. Lee Songha to our program\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief! Chief Jung Sunwoo! I\u2019m a Korean producer making a Chinese entertainment program. What are Ms. Lee Songha\u2019s plans on appearing on Chinese entertainment shows? If nothing\u2019s decided yet, could we talk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! I\u2019m the Beijing correspondent for a national paper! Could I interview\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust 5 minutes! Mr. Jung Sunwoo, please give us your comment\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was held up for almost 30 minutes going to the washroom and back.</p><br/><p>I was able to get away from the Chinese media with my lacking Chinese skills and body language, but the problem was those who approached me by speaking Korean. Correspondents from some paper or other. Korean producers and writers who Chinese broadcasting companies outsourced to create shows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are continuously organizing her interview schedule and broadcast appearances so we\u2019ll contact you through our Chinese agency once we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease contact us before the Chinese media!\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving a pile of business cards, I barely managed to go behind the stage when I saw Chief Lee Bongjoon giggling at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Jung Sunwoo, you\u2019re so popular.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo outside, chief. I bet you\u2019ll get your soul sucked out of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just Seo Jijoon\u2019s manager while you\u2019re famous. But maybe you\u2019ll become famous in China as well? Chinese people like superstitions. They love lucky people too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved my hand, and Chief Lee Bongjoon held his stomach and laughed even harder.</p><br/><p>This man wasn\u2019t in his right mind.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon quickly began chatting with someone from Huai TV. They had met not so long ago, yet they were so quick at making friends that they seemed like brothers already. They were now talking about going out for drinks and whatnot.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>A neat man wearing glasses struck a conversation.</p><br/><p>I greeted him before\u2026 Ah, he was from the Chinese agency W&amp;U had contracted. Although he was Chinese, he was so fluent in Korean that there was no problem with communicating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Ms. Lee Songha\u2019s going to have a lot more activities in China from now on, we might see each other often.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be the case. Please take care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should be the one asking you. How about getting a drink someday? We greeted the other chiefs before, but it\u2019s your first time here. I\u2019ll lead you to a good place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, please let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was talking to one person and another, the promotion event ended.</p><br/><p>Next to Seo Jijoon, who was wearing a suit, Lee Songha tightly held the hem of her dress as she made her way down the stage. Since it was her first time wearing such a long dress that dragged on the floor and because she wanted to come here, it was funny seeing how unsteady her steps were.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalk slowly. You might trip on your dress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, I didn\u2019t mess up on any of my Chinese lines-!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was preparing to compliment her, but I was suddenly hugged.</p><br/><p>By Seo Jijoon.</p><br/><p>Why were there so many people who wanted to hug me these days?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Chief Jung! How was I out there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were great, but please let go. Reporters are taking pictures.\u201d</p><br/><p>We were being serenaded with camera flashes.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stood agitated like she had been cut in line.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t I your manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon came over with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so moved that you\u2019re going to hug someone, you should be hugging me. They said if you devote yourself, you\u2019ll be worn-out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI became an international star thanks to Mr. Sunwoo. Just wait a sec, you\u2019re next, hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be second. Songha, stop standing there like your mother\u2019s been snatched away. Should we hug as people who\u2019ve been abandoned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, I knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjooon giggled when he was immediately rejected by Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>I tried to push Seo Jijoon away, yet chuckling, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo. You remember how I told you that I would repay the favor once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m holding onto it for when I need a really big favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdd one more, no, two more. I\u2019ll repay you threefold.\u201d</p><br/><p>I guess I should let him hug me since today was a good day.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re giving away blank cheques with no precaution. You don\u2019t even know what he\u2019ll ask from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to be generous! I\u2019m an international star now!\u201d</p><br/><p>I left Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon, who were having a laugh, and went to the waiting room with Lee Songha. Due to there being too many press correspondents and unknown people approaching us, security had to stick close to us until we arrived at the waiting room door.</p><br/><p>I went into the room with Lee Songha and examined the inside.</p><br/><p>I was checking to see if there weren\u2019t any hidden perverts or cameras.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out when you\u2019re done changing. I\u2019ll be waiting outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was heading to the door when something suddenly pounced on me from behind.</p><br/><p>Something smooth, soft, and warm.</p><br/><p>Then my forehead immediately banged against the door.</p><br/><p>Screaming in silence, I clasped my forehead with my hands when Lee Songha, who had clung to my back, almost like a piggyback, became shocked and got off me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, oppa, is your head okay? Your forehead\u2019s red!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s not cracked?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what were you-\u201c</p><br/><p>Astounded, I was about to turn around, but a security guard outside knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>I heard him ask if there was something wrong and if he should come in so I quickly told him everything was fine.</p><br/><p>Behind me, Lee Songha said in a whispering, quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI tripped over my dress. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were clearly on the other side\u2026 Rather than tripping, it\u2019s almost like you flew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I tripped.\u201d</p><br/><p>She read my expression and added as if making an excuse,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dress was the culprit.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Lee Songha and I were extremely busy.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the other Neptune members were touring Beijing, but that was like a dream for us. It wasn\u2019t enough that we were following our schedule by the minute, we had to cram practicing the Royal Family script into our sleep time.</p><br/><p>Then, the filming of Royal Family finally began.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the sunbed is in the camera frame! Please double check!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe finished setting up the cocktails in the pool bar.\u201d</p><br/><p>The film set was an outdoor hotel swimming pool that reached the peak of luxuriousness.</p><br/><p>The cast were Lee Songha and the numerous extras recruited here.</p><br/><p>And Seo Eunkyo joined the mix on top of that. Damn it.</p><br/><p>I was looking around at the swimming pool while waiting for Lee Songha to change into her swimsuit when Seo Eunkyo was coming over wearing a gown. It was my first time seeing her since handing her over to a security guard after she collapsed in the hotel hallway.</p><br/><p>How much of that day did she remember?</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, what swimsuit is Lee Songha wearing?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed she blacked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bikini?

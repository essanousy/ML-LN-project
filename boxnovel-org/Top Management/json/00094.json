There wasn\u2019t any other pain besides that. I quickly took in a deep breath like someone who had been submerged in water. Then I looked around at my surroundings.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the streets of Sinchon.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the street where screams erupted out and people scattered chaotically. I was in the room with purple lights, the room that I had entered an hour ago to pick my superpower.</p><br/><p>What the heck? Just what happened?</p><br/><p>Taken aback, I had been calming myself by taking deep breaths when Producer Bae hesitantly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, were you just acting just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Song Yujin added in with widened eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, while it isn\u2019t the future foresight ability we had set up, let\u2019s try to save this since it\u2019s a shame to waste it. It\u2019s realistic. I almost thought that today\u2019s concept was a thriller.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was good, right? Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Bae placed the fallen chair upright as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, did you see the future just now? What kind of future was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of future was it?</p><br/><p>The woman who rolled on the ground after being hit by the truck was still vivid in my mind. Screams echoed in my ears, and I gasped when I saw the truck about to hit Lee Songha and the baby. Then that truck\u2026</p><br/><p>What happened after?</p><br/><p>No, more importantly\u2026 Everything wasn\u2019t real?</p><br/><p>I got on the elevator with the cameraman. It opened on the first floor. When we went out to the rear parking lot, I saw the staff chatting and two vans for the members. They were all things I had seen before.</p><br/><p>I looked down. My feet were on the concrete floor of the parking lot. So I was walking on the ground properly. It had felt like the floor was rolling.</p><br/><p>I got on the driver\u2019s seat of the black van.</p><br/><p>After a familiar greeting, Hwang Jaehyun asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou picked a card too, right? What kind of power is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Future prophet. Do you\u2026 have the power to stop time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I heard it previously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, does the future prophet know other people\u2019s powers too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess so. But what\u2019s wrong with your complexion? Relax. It\u2019s too exaggerated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Bae probably asked for something weird again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of the two talking and laughing seemed so distant.</p><br/><p>I exhaled the breath I had been holding back and wracked my brain, which was currently like a rusty machine.</p><br/><p>First, things were following what happened in my memory. What I saw, which I wasn\u2019t certain if describing it that way was correct, seemed like it would be the future that would unfold soon.</p><br/><p>However, it was in a completely different format than before.</p><br/><p>There was no static or myself 20 years in the future, and I could move on my own. However, it was so realistic that I couldn\u2019t even consider it as the future.</p><br/><p>Even now, rather than feeling like I had seen the future, I felt like I had returned to the past.</p><br/><p>Why? Why was it different from before?</p><br/><p>I looked for a clue within my foggy mind when, suddenly, I recalled the last scene. Lee Taehee pushed my back, but the power in her thin arms was insignificant. Most likely, we were all hit by the truck the next moment.</p><br/><p>I was probably hit too. I might have even been in a critical state.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because of that? Was the method in which I saw the future different from the others until now because I would be in a large accident incomparable to the others? While it was only a guess, that was all I could think of for now.</p><br/><p>Just then, Lee Taehee got in the car. The moment I recalled her pushing my back, my mind jolted awake as if cold water had been poured on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, just why did you-!\u201d</p><br/><p>I unknowingly shouted before stopping. I almost made a mistake. The others were looking at me with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour manager is the future prophet. It seems he\u2019s been seeing things since a while ago. It has even gone beyond the realm of role-playing. Look at how realistic his expression is. Joowon. What are you doing? Stop losing to the guest and reflect on yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWorry about yourself. I\u2019m trying to get into character.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Hwang Jaehyun and Im Joowon were chatting, Lee Taehee leaned towards the driver\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes something happen to me in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I think something will happen today. So be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her light brown eyes curled into a smile.</p><br/><p>Next, the child actress Song Yuri and Lee Songha got in one after another. Lee Songha said she picked \u2018Hypnotist\u2019 as she glanced at my forehead while holding a black marker, and Im Joowon and Song Yuri discussed changing companies. Then Producer Bae passed me a box of dice.</p><br/><p>With the box in hand, I thought for a moment.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the results would be different this time.</p><br/><p>However, this thought disappeared the moment I took off the sticker of the red die.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Superhuman team will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018In one hour, on the streets of Sinchon, with civilians, complete a mission.\u2019</p><br/><p>Gulping dryly, I looked at Lee Taehee and Lee Songha. The two probably couldn\u2019t imagine what would happen to them in an hour.</p><br/><p>My grip on the steering wheel tightened.</p><br/><p>There were many moments when I thought that I changed the present after seeing the future until now. However, I was more desperate than ever before.</p><br/><p>Should I act crazy and say I couldn\u2019t go? Or tell them I had certain circumstances? Faint after saying I wasn\u2019t feeling well? Or just drive in a completely different direction? If I did, then we probably wouldn\u2019t be involved in that incident.</p><br/><p>With a complicated mind, I recalled the chaotic scene.</p><br/><p>Producer Bae knocked on the window, telling me to start driving. I bit my lips and started the van. I needed time to think. I had to think of something on our way.</p><br/><p>What method would be the best to change the future?</p><br/><p>The scene in my memory played out in front of me.</p><br/><p>I saw couples laughing and chatting while enjoying the event and families with strollers. The streets of Sinchon were extremely peaceful and normal, just like before the incident.</p><br/><p>Since the truck would rush in here soon, I would have liked it if everything could be handled by shouting to everyone, telling them to run away, but there were cameras. I shook my head after calculating the storm that would sweep through my life afterwards.</p><br/><p>Before Producer Bae distributed the missions, I told him,</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, I\u2019m going to go to the washroom. That U-Plex building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. But it\u2019ll be good if you hurry since the Researcher team has found your location and are on their way here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I told Lee Songha and Lee Taehee to stay with the staff and walked away, almost running. Of course, I wasn\u2019t planning on coming back before the incident took place.</p><br/><p>I was relieved since this place was quite a distance away from the location of the incident, and if the five celebrities stayed together without dispersing, civilians would gather here as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, the \u2018Now, We\u2019 team is over there! Let\u2019s go there, quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my god, what in the world! Autographs, where can we go get autographs?\u201d</p><br/><p>I passed the rushing people and approached a gigantic building. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t need to lie to lose my cameraman. He raised his camera and stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be filming the crowds in front of the building so come here when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was filming, I entered the building and left through a different exit. Then I took off the mic on my shirt and called 112<sup>{1}</sup>.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to report a drunken driver. It was a water bottle truck and the driver seemed very drunk. There are a lot of people on the streets right now because of an event and someone might get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>I constantly thought about it on my way here.</p><br/><p>Why did the truck charge into a vehicle-prohibited area?</p><br/><p>I came up with three hypotheses.</p><br/><p>The truck was broken and couldn\u2019t stop. Though, if this was the case, then the question was why the driver drove into a crowd of people instead of turning towards the trees on the side of the street or something.</p><br/><p>My second hypothesis was that the driver was drunk and wasn\u2019t in his right mind. If not, then he might be a crazy person with a lot of dissatisfaction towards the world trying to commit an unspeakable crime.</p><br/><p>Which was why I reported him as a drunk driver. Other reasons were that it looked like drunk driving, and it was the most likely and easiest to make up and manage.</p><br/><p>Soon, I was told that it had been reported to the police. They said they would dispatch officers right away.</p><br/><p>I stood in the middle of the street and recalled the place of the incident.</p><br/><p>That time, I was in the middle of Yonsei Street, and the commotion was in the front, not too far away. There was quite a distance between me and the traffic circle. If the water bottle truck had charged through the traffic circle, then the commotion would have gone on for much longer.</p><br/><p>Then there was a bigger chance that it came out from an alley in between.</p><br/><p>When I arrived, there was a pathway for cars to pass between the left and right alleys like a crosswalk for cars. While there were traffic cones and poles set up so that cars wouldn\u2019t drive out of the pathway, when I touched them, they were made of plastic, empty inside, and had no strength. At least there was a rectangular bar that seemed quite heavy, seemingly filled with sand, but it felt like cars could still charge through it.</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue out of nervousness when I got a call from the producer.</p><br/><p>-Mr. Sunwoo, where are you? The cameraman says he can\u2019t find you?</p><br/><p>I thought about it for a second before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, I saw a drunken driver up the street. The driver seemed to be in a really bad condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Pardon? What did you say?</p><br/><p>\u201cWorried that there might be a big accident, I am looking around for the car. Err, just in case, could you gather the civilians\u2019 attention? Maybe encourage a cheer?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Err\u2026. Mr. Sunwoo, are you serious right now? It\u2019s not a part of your concept?</p><br/><p>He sounded flustered. I would be the same if I was in his position.</p><br/><p>After I told him that I had reported it to the police, dazed, Producer Bae said he understood. Not long after, I heard cheers behind me.</p><br/><p>While waiting for the police, I checked to see if there was a water bottle truck in either of the two alleys. The alleys were complex like a maze. While I did see a few cars, none were the one from my memory.</p><br/><p>During this time, people laughed and chatted as they passed me. I informed the civilians. At first, when I told them about the drunk driver, their expressions asked, \u2018So what?\u2019, but when I told them about celebrities, they were instantly enthralled.</p><br/><p>Well, who could imagine an incident that they had only ever seen on the news where a car charged down the street into people? Even I, who personally saw it, wondered if it was real in that moment.</p><br/><p>Time kept passing. My chest felt stiff from nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo! I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you. What was that about?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cameraman ran towards me while carrying his camera.</p><br/><p>The moment I looked back at him, accompanied by the rough sound of an engine, a truck came out from the alley on the other side and crashed into the traffic cones. It was an old truck with water bottles loaded on its trunk. It was the truck I had seen.</p><br/><p>The people around me scattered while screaming. Like an agitated bull, the truck crashed into the traffic cones and the delineator posts. The powerless traffic cones flew out in various directions, and I saw those hit by them fall before hastily getting back up and fleeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha-what the heck? What\u2019s wrong with that truck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, that scared me! Is there a problem with the car? Why\u2019s it going nuts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that driver crazy? Hey, hey, reported him to the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>I still didn\u2019t see the police and the water bottle truck was going nuts, going around in circles, before stopping momentarily after crashing into the traffic cones and the heavy rectangular bar. Relief crossed people\u2019s expressions.</p><br/><p>However, the real commotion hadn\u2019t begun.</p><br/><p>Damn. I swore while rushing in at full speed.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I had never rushed into or even thought about rushing into a situation like this.</p><br/><p>But, when I thought about how the car would charge towards people once it started moving again, strength went into my legs as I recalled the last moment I had seen.</p><br/><p>I instantly approached the side of the truck. When I grabbed the door handle and pulled it open, I was overwhelmed with a thick stench of alcohol. A middle-aged man turned to look at me with his hands on the steering wheel. Looking at his eyes, he didn\u2019t seem to be in his right mind.</p><br/><p>Without the time to think about it, I grabbed the middle-aged man and dragged him out of the driver\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 So we\u2019re going to stop the recording for a bit. The recording isn\u2019t the problem right now, no, it is. The recording is a problem, but I\u2019m just too flustered right now. I\u2019m telling you that a big accident could have happened here! It\u2019s crazy, police cars and-!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned back after finishing my conversation with the officers, who arrived a little late, Producer Bae Junghwan was talking gibberish into his phone. The other staff members and cast members were looking at me with expressions of \u2018Just what happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Neptune girls were anxious and rushed towards me as soon as they saw me. Their already light faces were as white as paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-oppa, oppa, are you okay? We felt like our hearts were about to drop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is going on\u2026 Are-are you hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop standing there stupidly and turn around so that we can see if you\u2019re alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, Lee Taehee, and LJ gathered around me and examined my condition. Lee Songha was a few steps away from me, standing rigidly and unblinking, as she stared at me as though she was stricken with fear.</p><br/><p>To be honest, I was partly out of it, but because the girls\u2019 reactions were so intense, my mind crawled back to its senses. After showing them that I was alright and comforting them, the mood relaxed a little.</p><br/><p>Hwang Jaehyun and the other celebrities came up to me after the girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you blocked a drunken driver charging into the streets with your body. Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you stopped a truck and fought with the driver. Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No. If I had that sort of talent, I would have become a national athlete.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while exhaling the breath I had been holding in. Mingling in their noisy conversation, I finally felt like the incident was over. Only after I relaxed my shoulders did I realize how tense I was.</p><br/><p>Producer Bae hung up his phone and was about to approach me.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, producer. They are from the organization hosting the culture market or something event today. They apparently have something to say to you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The floor director brought over the people from the event and an employee from the district office. The man who had thanked me multiple times a few moments ago lowered his head to Producer Bae and requested,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mood is a bit uneasy because people are shocked by the incident just now. If it\u2019s not too much trouble, could the celebrities tell them that it\u2019s fine and to relax?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hwang Jaehyun\u2019s question, the event organizer looked at the celebrities and me and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the person who personally resolved the incident is here and because you are all famous, if you all say something, then I think the mood will quickly calm down. Would you consider it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, saying something isn\u2019t difficult\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the mood calms, then I think we\u2019ll be able to get the mood to naturally settle down since an indie band is going to arrive soon and begin their performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>An indie band. A performance. As soon as I heard this, I suddenly thought of something.</p><br/><p>The reason why I decided to appear on this entertainment show, which I had completely forgotten due to the incident.</p><br/><p>I looked at the surrounding cameras, civilians, and the girls, who were calming their surprised hearts. Then I approached the event organizer and Producer Bae, who were talking with each other, and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, how about Neptune performs a song as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The staff were moving busily. Producer Bae glanced at the camera and lighting equipment being set up in front of the small stage as he ended his call. Then he gestured to Jung Sunwoo and his cameraman, who were nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to check the tape. If you filmed the scene, they want us to send it to the newsroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard this, Writer Song Yujin\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe newsroom? It\u2019ll be on the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there aren\u2019t any severely injured people or anything, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be as newsworthy, but if we have the scene, then it\u2019s an exclusive for us. They\u2019ll check the recording and determine if it\u2019s worth showing in a news brief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Bae said with a still dazed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news is the news, but how are we supposed to edit this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Stopping in thought, he pointed to the cameraman and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou followed Mr. Sunwoo in the end, right? Mr. Sunwoo rushing into the scene, how much of it did you get?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cameraman handed him his 6mm camera and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Korea\u2019s emergency telephone number.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-93\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 93\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-95\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 95\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201301\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

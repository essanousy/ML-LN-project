However, he looked quite happy like a person who was finally about to poop after being constipated.</p><br/><p>Seeing his smiling face, I could figure out what kind of discussion they were having.</p><br/><p>I turned my gaze and looked at the people from Well-Made Production. An awkward expression flashed on General Manager Sung and the marketing head\u2019s faces. It was a different attitude compared when they were happy that promoting their drama would be a breeze when I became a hot topic.</p><br/><p>If I was emptyhanded, I would have felt slightly upset.</p><br/><p>Still, my lips turned crooked at my displeasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to do my job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy job. I have something to show you regarding Songha and Royal Family\u2019s incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I calmly said this, the Well-Made Production employees looked awkward.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo calm at a time like this. Don\u2019t you know that you should lie low until things die down-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSit down comfortably. Don\u2019t just stand there.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung cut him off. He gestured towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear what he has to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader shut his mouth while unable to control his expression. It seemed he couldn\u2019t bring himself to contradict the CEO as he just gave me an unfavorable look. It seemed this person didn\u2019t like anything I did, no, it seemed he just didn\u2019t like me in general.</p><br/><p>Well, that feeling was mutual.</p><br/><p>I handed CEO Baek Hansung my laptop and sat in an empty seat.</p><br/><p>An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as he looked at the small laptop screen. At first, people glanced at my laptop out of curiosity, but it seemed they felt it was inappropriate to crane their necks to see as their gazes soon fell on me.</p><br/><p>Besides the director. He didn\u2019t care and craned his neck out to see it.</p><br/><p>The marketing head at Well-Made Production explained their circumstances with an apologetic face,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry things became like this, Chief Jung. While we benefited from you these past few days, scandals are double-edged swords. When a scandal breaks out regarding an actress, the drama\u2019s immersion might drop, and in extreme cases, the chemistry between actors may suffer.</p><br/><p>General Manager Sung smacked his lips and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think there will be any problem since a correction will be made, but our investors are quite worried considered the amount of money being moved around. If you have someone else take care of Ms. Lee Songha\u2019s personal schedule until things die down, we think it\u2019ll be easier to persuade our investors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, if it\u2019s something like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader\u2019s face brightened at their words. I could clearly see that he intended on using this opportunity to change Lee Songha\u2019s manager completely and not until things die down.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader checked CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s reaction. CEO Baek Hansung was only staring at the screen with a delighted expression. It seemed the team 2 leader took his expression as an approving one as he readily nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince issues regarding scandals are laid out in the contract, it is only proper we handle it properly so that there aren\u2019t any rumors. It\u2019s not like this is our first time doing business with Well-Made either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader chattered happily like a fish in water.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t even need a meeting for a matter like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, isn\u2019t this a problem regarding W&amp;U\u2019s personnel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like an actor is changing. All we\u2019re doing is changing the chief assigned to her. We\u2019ll handle this without any hiccups through an internal meeting and make sure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the team leader says so, then we\u2019re relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing behind CEO Baek Hansung, the team 3 leader\u2019s brows wriggled. His expression read, \u2018He\u2019s enjoying himself.\u2019 My expression was probably the same. However, either of us cut into their conversation.</p><br/><p>Because there would soon be an entertaining scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about this matter any longer. You already have more than enough on your plate with trying to decide on the male lead. You need to hurry up and sign someone considering the filming schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Sung clicked his tongue and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to bring that up. When Yoon Taekyung and Park Dojin both said they wanted to do the project, we thought that we had hit jackpot, but choosing between the two is tough. The staff and investors are divided on who to choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a shame to lose either one of them since they are both at the top in regards to global Korean stars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amused, I perked my ears at their conversation.</p><br/><p>Since I already handed the evidence to CEO Baek Hansung, I no longer had to rush. I was also very excited to see their expression, especially the team 2 leader\u2019s, when they learn that one of those \u2018precious actors\u2019 would ruin everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts, team leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader rubbed his beard at General Manager Sung\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoon Taekyung has a good personality, and Park Dojin seemed like a good person as well when I had dinner with him last time. It\u2019s a shame you have to choose one of the two, but no matter who you choose, it\u2019s certain that the drama will be a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Our concerns seem like complaints when compared to our peers who are having a hard time even casting people.\u201d</p><br/><p>What the heck were you saying when \u2018ruin\u2019 was dangling in front of you?</p><br/><p>I laughed along with them as they laughed in satisfaction. Hahaha.</p><br/><p>When the marketing head saw me laugh, she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you, Chief Jung? Which one do you think is best?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was she asking me? Did she think that I had no feelings because I was laughing at a time like this?</p><br/><p>When I showed my displeasure, she examined my expression, thinking that she made a mistake. Since she tried to retract her words and apologize, I simply shrugged my shoulders and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine. That was going to be my condition anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you need to undoubtedly cast Mr. Yoon Taekyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>The marketing head and General Manager Sung looked at me strangely.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader had an expression that read, \u2018What nonsense is he saying now?\u2019 before suddenly frowning. He quickly stared at the laptop that CEO Baek Hansung passed to the director.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Jung Sunwoo, don\u2019t tell me that \u2018your job\u2019 you were referring to just now was regarding Royal Family\u2019s male lead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded while hoping my nonchalant expression would get his panties in a bunch.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader opened and closed his mouth as if at a loss for words, and those from Well-Made Production looked taken aback. After glancing at them, the team 2 leader tightly clenched the sofa\u2019s armrest. He looked like he would shout if they weren\u2019t present.</p><br/><p>Boiling with anger, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019re mistaken because people around you call you \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 and tell you that you have good senses, but do you think this is something you can just come in and comment on?\u201d</p><br/><p>I glanced at CEO Baek Hansung. He too was staring at me. It was still difficult to figure out what he was thinking. If I were to guess, he seemed to be amused.</p><br/><p>Maybe something like, \u2018I wonder where someone like him came along?\u2019</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader behind him was giving me an amused look as well.</p><br/><p>Since it seemed like they would let things slide if I rolled my tongue a little, I smiled and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, like you said, this isn\u2019t something I can comment about, but I couldn\u2019t just let things be when the drama might flop at this rate. Then even Songha will be affected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Flop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they cast Mr. Park Dojin, the drama might completely flop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because I said it so casually, but they all seemed to suspect they heard me wrong. While the team 2 leader opened and closed his mouth like a bearded goldfish, General Manager Sung, who was first to recover, said in a serious expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe drama flopping, what are you saying? Why would Royal Family flop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA scandal will break out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA scandal? If it\u2019s a scandal, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While mumbling, a frown creased General Manager Sung\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Lee Songha and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rumor. Also, how could a drama flop with a scandal like that? It\u2019s not like a dating scandal is something huge. It has to be at least a drug scandal for it to be huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>The air in the office froze.</p><br/><p>Their eyes went wide as they wore shocked expressions, especially the team 2 leader. He was quite a sight. Enjoying his dumbfounded expression, I looked at the director who was holding my laptop.</p><br/><p>Astonished, the director asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the guy in these photos is really Park Dojin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my. A druggie lead in a Korean-Chinese project. If this broke out while we were broadcasting, then we would have suffered greatly and the drama would have been a complete failure.\u201d</p><br/><p>People in the office jumped to their feet. Then they hastily gathered next to the director. Whenever there was a \u2018click\u2019, their faces gradually grew more shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-what is this? Is this really that Park Dojin bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I think so. Even though it\u2019s blurry, the outline of his face and his facial features are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018I think so\u2019?! Ms. Kyunghee, did you know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I knew, I would have told you already! This is my first time seeing this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy bastard, he shouldn\u2019t have kept quiet about something like this\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>While General Manager Sung and the marketing head\u2019s faces alternated between pale and red, the team 2 leader opened and closed his mouth with his gaze fixated on the screen. When he looked at me with confusion and disbelief, I simply shrugged.</p><br/><p>The director, having handed them the laptop, looked at me and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm, where did you hear about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019m also curious about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung, who had been quiet all this time, added. The team 3 leader also said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, how did you find this when not even rats or birds knew about it<sup>{1}</sup>?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if rats and birds didn\u2019t know about it, the paparazzi did. I got it directly from the paparazzi.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director was taken aback by my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe paparazzi? You received this directly from the paparazzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you were going to meet reporters or something, so it was this?\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked like the team 3 leader heard a few things from Kim Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 It seemed now was the time to show off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was looking around to make sure there wouldn\u2019t be any problems because this was an important next project for Songha when I came across some unpleasant information. I asked around and found this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this wonderful charm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director came up to me and patted my shoulder as he laughed.</p><br/><p>Just then, stammering, the team 2 leader cut in,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This is really Park Dojin? You can\u2019t say with 100% cert-\u201c</p><br/><p>Since it seemed like he didn\u2019t want to face reality, I said with a brighter smile than before,</p><br/><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t the best shots. The paparazzi has better photos. They\u2019ll probably be published soon. If Park Dojin was cast, I think Star Search of Hong Kong was planning on releasing it when Royal Family was at its peak, but since this information was leaked because of me, they\u2019ll probably release it sooner.\u201d</p><br/><p>I told them what I knew. The color drained from the two Well-Made Production people\u2019s faces, and when I mentioned Star Search, their faces went pale.</p><br/><p>They looked at me with gazes filled with various emotions then looked at CEO Baek Hansung. After a long time, they finally recollected themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, CEO Baek Hansung, we\u2019ll contact you soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>After tightly holding my hand and asking for CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s understanding, they quickly ran out to the office. I heard the sounds of them on the phone growing distant.</p><br/><p>Something about stopping everything regarding Park Dojin\u2019s contract immediately and to keep a lid on it so that it doesn\u2019t leak to the press. To hurriedly schedule a meeting to resolve this before the investors are shaken by this news. Stuff like that.</p><br/><p>The only ones left in the office were CEO Baek Hansung, the director, team 3 leader, and me.</p><br/><p>Also, a red-faced team 2 leader staring at the laptop screen.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader smiled crookedly as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You had dinner with Park Dojin and he seemed like a good person? What \u2018good person\u2019? What were you going to do if we signed an exclusive contract with him? My, my. Just thinking about it sends chills down my spine. How can I trust your eyes now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader couldn\u2019t utter a word despite being harshly mocked. Let alone arguing back, he looked more urgent to figure out a way to save his skin.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung tapped his sofa\u2019s armrest as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam 2 leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your hands off Lee Songha\u2019s matter now. Don\u2019t bring up changing her manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said slowly yet firmly before looking at me and saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding Lee Songha, I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a chief better than Jung Sunwoo in Team 2.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a storm had gone by.</p><br/><p>Looking like he was running away, the team 2 leader was first to leave the CEO\u2019s office. I felt refreshed. I hoped I didn\u2019t have to see him for a while.</p><br/><p>The director and the team 3 leader chattered noisily. Of course, they were talking about me. I answered their questions as vaguely as possible and took my laptop and the USB drive. Then I looked at CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>He had been observing me for a while now.</p><br/><p>With a gaze that tingled my spine.</p><br/><p>I cleared my throat. I planned on telling Lee Songha of today\u2019s victory once I received a definite answer regarding my position. This was because I had to sit her down in front of me and ask her a few questions.</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to speak,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two can go and do your work.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said first.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, I hope you can stay behind so we can talk. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Pretty self-explanatory.

Second chapter of the week!}</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little seedling learned to scheme from W&amp;U.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang snorted when he heard about the call with Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>Producer Choi nervously paced back and forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked around and there really are a few production companies and networks interested in the reality TV show. Even PBS.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, since it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do if Chief Jung Sunwoo really takes the proposal to some other network? The director will be angry if the show is a success after going to a different network despite them having come to us first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are timid. How can someone like you be a producer?\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang gave Producer Choi an unpleasant look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many years of experience do you have for you to be played as a fool by some seedling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being played. There just always an \u2018if\u2019. I\u2019m just worried things might actually fall through. Isn\u2019t it better to keep our conditions moderate and going into production? Once it goes into production, we\u2019ll have the upper hand again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel like letting them off. I\u2019m too disgusted by his actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang\u2019s lips became crooked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is thinking lightly of me, a public network general manager, because cable networks and subcontract production companies are treating him well. That\u2019s why he\u2019s trying to get a deal with us while acting like he might go to a different network. He\u2019s too wet behind the ears for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the article on his phone, he added,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sudden article. That guy might be acting after releasing it himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI looked into it, and it seems like some high schooler posted it on social media.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard masking the origin of a source. It\u2019ll spread so long as it gets passed along a couple times. Anyways, I don\u2019t plan on letting him go. Him insisting like this will only be momentary. Even if his scheme might work at other networks, he won\u2019t fool me.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what if Chief Jung is unsatisfied and is ready to pull Seoyoung and LJ off the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Choi said with a gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if he decides to cancel his appearance on Good Friends\u2019 long-term project and simply goes to a different network?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can do that if he has the guts.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guts to turn his back on an entire network.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he does as you said, then I\u2019m going straight to the director. You know that the director hates rude brats like him. He has a bad temper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chuckling, General Manager Hwang continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll like it if I tell him that a W&amp;U chief took his celebrities out of our show because he was cranky, and he only baited us with the proposal before passing it over to another network?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we are the ones who brought up kicking them off the show if he doesn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just need to talk to the director. An arm always leans inward.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang, who smoothly glossed things over, gestured to Producer Choi.</p><br/><p>A cunning smile hung on his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Jung Sunwoo, that bastard, exactly what I told you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll come to us with his head bowed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Choi blinked at General Manager\u2019s confident attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does have the rank to blow things up any further. It\u2019s not like W&amp;U is some mom and pop shop. They have tons of employees and celebrities. Do you think they\u2019ll clash against a network because one of their employees is cranky? I bet their company would be against his actions first. Also, you said he was only a temporary team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he became a temporary team leader after being assigned this project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll definitely want to handle things on his own. If this escalates up to our director, do you think the W&amp;U CEO won\u2019t interfere? Then he\u2019s just admitting he doesn\u2019t have the ability to hit at the negotiations table.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Choi was in awe at those words. His worries were cleanly swept off his mind.</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang leisurely crossed his legs as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to break in these bastards that don\u2019t know their place.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>-This could really become a big incident if this reaches our director.</p><br/><p>Producer Choi sighed.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019ll try to soothe General Manager Hwang\u2019s anger a little, so please just bow your head once this time. If this tug-o-war continues, it won\u2019t end with just you and our general manager. It could escalate to a problem between W&amp;U and IBC.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo replied while rubbing his dry lips.</p><br/><p>Producer Choi\u2019s voice clearly became brighter. They ended the call after saying they would get in touch after an internal discussion.</p><br/><p>A silence hung in the meeting room. Chief Lee Taeshin soothed his parched throat with his lukewarm coffee. The emotions that surged during Jung Sunwoo\u2019s call with Producer Choi Byungsoo had no intention of calming down.</p><br/><p>A threat saying they would crush them with power if he didn\u2019t do as they said. The way that an influential producer and general manager of a public network worked was beyond shameless.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin gave Jung Sunwoo a worried look.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt his mind was complicated with the blatant pressure they were weighing on him. Jung Sunwoo was expressionlessly looking at his coffee cup. His arms and legs were crossed. He looked like a coiled snake.</p><br/><p>Soon, he made a bitter smile as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if it was the team leader or the CEO instead of me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, there\u2019s no need for you to feel bad. It\u2019s rare for someone with little experience like you to be assigned such a big project. General Manager Hwang, that man, probably felt disregarded when you went over with the proposal by yourself. People like him really care about positions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park patted his shoulder. Then she lightly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat now? Do you want to ask the CEO for help? I bet it\u2019ll be cleanly settled then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin gulped.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo\u2019s lips rose in a crooked manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait a little longer. I took out an insurance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn insurance\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin asked with a perplexed expression.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo smiled faintly as he replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought this would happen, so I had drinks until early morning. With a director I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA d-director?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>IBC\u2019s Drama Department.</p><br/><p>The director roughly undid his necktie as he entered. The noisy drama director and production assistants quickly shut their mouths. He looked around with his big, bright eyes on his way to his office.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there so many people in the office sitting on their asses? Do none of you have a film shoot? You need to be filming one more scene instead of twiddling your thumbs if you want to make a great hit! PBS\u2019s Royal Family is about to exceed 25% in ratings, yet are you not jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>After shouting, he entered his office.</p><br/><p>Two men followed after him. They were Director Moon, who had been doing well in his career before flopping a mini-series and was preparing for his next project with gnashed teeth, and the chief producer, General Manager Kim. The director burned with rage when he saw Director Moon.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoon Hyesung, did you cast a lead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even ask for a timeslot until you get a top star male and female lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something I want to say about that. I can\u2019t stand it any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Moon said with a grim face.</p><br/><p>The director blinked at his serious mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can\u2019t you stand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you said, I want to cast top stars as the leads. I want to get ratings like Royal Family! That\u2019s why I earnestly beg actors and their managers and send them fruit baskets. But what\u2019s the point if the Entertainment Department messes it all up?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if the Entertainment Department abuse their power over agencies, but they shouldn\u2019t let that negatively affect us. Do we try to cast actors multiple times because we have no pride?\u201d</p><br/><p>Furious, Director Moon grumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cI should have been an Entertainment producer instead. I\u2019m just wasting my hard work trying to make dramas\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he suddenly acting like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director looked at General Manager Kim with perplexed eyes. The general manager clicked his tongue and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was in progress with a potential candidate, but it was all foiled by the Entertainment Department. Our employees are quite unsatisfied because of incidents like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Moon poked General Manager Kim as if he was urging him to go on.</p><br/><p>General Manager Kim added,</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if the Entertainment and Drama Departments are divided, we are still part of IBC. Agencies don\u2019t look at us favorably when they are screwed over by them. Why is it that we have to clean up their mess all the time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation went on for about ten more minutes.</p><br/><p>Sighing, the director waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I got it. I\u2019ll talk it over with their director so that this doesn\u2019t happen again if possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having obtained a satisfactory answer, Director Moon and General Manager Kim left the office.</p><br/><p>Director Moon said in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your help, general manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven without you bringing it up, this was a problem we needed to discuss. Also, tell me honestly, what did you gain from W&amp;U\u2019s Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I gain something?\u201d</p><br/><p>The general manager snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you guys drank until early morning. Aren\u2019t you helping him out like this because you\u2019ve gained something? If it\u2019s something good, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about much. We simply drank together. After a few drinks, Chief Jung was complaining about he would in such a difficult situation. That\u2019s why I decided to help him out a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Moon licked his dry lips and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to look at the future. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to only make one project and Chief Jung is going to be a chief forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy is a temporary team leader at W&amp;U. He was a road manager two years ago, became a chief last year, and a temporary team leader this year. Who knows where he\u2019ll be next year? I\u2019m just trying to get on good terms with him by helping him out when he\u2019s in a tough spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Moon made a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but you did gain something, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>IBC\u2019s Entertainment director was a cold, temperamental person.</p><br/><p>He nodded after glancing through the reality TV show proposal with W&amp;U\u2019s logo on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOthers will be attracted to this. It\u2019s fun. We must do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang\u2019s expression brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe proposal is good, but the key is Jung Sunwoo. He\u2019s a hot topic right now, and his image is still fresh since he hasn\u2019t appeared on many shows. There\u2019s a ton we can benefit by putting him on our shows. I\u2019m taming him right now so-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cTell General Manager Jo to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Manager Jo.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang made a flustered expression. He grabbed an employee outside and relayed the order. General Manager Jo entered the office within five minutes.</p><br/><p>Half his hair was already grey, and he wore glasses and had defined wrinkles around his eyes. Overall, he had a scholarly appearance, but red sauce stain on his chin and clothes made him look ten years younger.</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang frowned as they weren\u2019t close despite being colleagues.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have all that muck on you when you\u2019re coming to meet the director?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this? I ate a bit of the tteok-bokki a few of the writers ordered as a snack.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Jo scratched his head.</p><br/><p>The director handed him the proposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a proposal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTry to restart discussions with the agency.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! Just what-!\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang shot up from his seat after belatedly understanding the situation.</p><br/><p>The director told him,</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your hands off this project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of this project.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Manager Hwang blankly opened andclosed his mouth.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Acommon dish with stir-fried rice cakes in spicy sauce.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-155\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 155\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-157\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 157\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201424\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

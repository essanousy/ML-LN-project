Damn it! It hurts so much I could die!\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>It was the meeting room of the movie production company, SBE Films.</p><br/><p>The project producer tossed his tablet aside. The middle-aged man with his eyes glued to an actor\u2019s profile, Director Choi Sungwon, sitting beside him smiled with wrinkled eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have a stomach ache, go to the washroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Choi! That\u2019s not what I mean!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it hurt a lot? Then go to the hospital. I\u2019ll handle the meeting on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I have a stomach ache because of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer pushed his tablet to Director Choi Sungwon.</p><br/><p>Director Choi looked at the screen. The headline was written in huge letters.</p><br/><p>{Jung Sunwoo, the man who made an international star, temporarily returns to Korea for a new movie? What kind of movie is it?}</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, we already planned out a promotion strategy around Chief Jung Sunwoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have released an article before they did it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t signed the contract yet! I was going to ask him during our meeting today and release it right away! Our reporters were all waiting!\u201d</p><br/><p>The red-faced project producer gulped down a glass of cold water.</p><br/><p>Director Choi rubbed his wispy beard as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why not release articles now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other film is already sucking all the benefits, what do we become if we break the news now? We\u2019ll be sidelined. Also, we look like we\u2019re trying to suck up whatever\u2019s left! So humiliating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t release it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hyung, just keep looking at the profiles. Don\u2019t make me burst.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer gnashed before raising his cup. It was empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer swore as he beat his chest. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if he collapsed from oxygen deprivation.</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon handed him his own cup and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMovies only need to be good. Promotions are a minor issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we in the 90s? All projects need to be good. Huge box office successes are created by pouring money into promotions. We poured 8 billion into marketing this time. It\u2019s that important. That\u2019s why Ace is pouring articles out about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer emptied Director Choi\u2019s cup in one go and grumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung Sunwoo, I didn\u2019t think of him like that. So mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow what\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe decided to meet with us today but gives the articles about his new project to some other project! Morals still exist! He went too far! He should have at least told us before the articles went up\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer didn\u2019t finish his sentence.</p><br/><p>It was noisy outside. He saw a man in a suit outside the clear glass door. He walked straight towards them as he took off his sunglasses, revealing sharp, cold appearance.</p><br/><p>The female employee who guided them to the meeting room entered first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guests have already, should I prepare coffee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat coffee? Bring cold water.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy\u2019s an actor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Choi abruptly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat actor? He\u2019s Chief Jung Sunwoo. Wear glasses if you can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not him, the one behind him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer turned his gaze. He finally saw an unfamiliar man behind Chief Jung Sunwoo. He had a handsome face, a good body, but as someone who had met almost all the top stars in the country, he wasn\u2019t especially eye-catching.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he a rookie from W&amp;U? Where did you see him? It\u2019s my first time seeing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first time too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s an actor when it\u2019s your first time seeing him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can tell just by looking at him. He has the aura.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat aura? Put your glasses on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer pushed his chair back and got up as he said in a grumbling manner,</p><br/><p>\u201cA contract is a contract, but I can\u2019t stop myself from saying something because of how much it hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The project producer had a sour look on his face.</p><br/><p>It was expected since he would have seen the articles plastered on the internet.</p><br/><p>Just as we sat down, he said in a clear voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw the articles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the articles.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while rubbing my chin like I didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can understand Ace Distribution Company breaking the news since they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to lose such a big marketing opportunity, but still, we just haven\u2019t signed, didn\u2019t we already have a verbal agreement?\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer continued while trying to suppress his temper,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we can\u2019t ask you to only help marketing our movie or anything like that, but morally, this is a bit awkward in our perspective since we had a lot of plans regarding marketing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? I wonder why they published those articles?\u201d</p><br/><p>I said nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>The project producer\u2019s eyes bulged. His expression was asking what I was saying.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon, who was sitting quietly next to me, stared at me.</p><br/><p>With an awkward expression, or at least I tried to, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe decided not to be in that movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Not be in the movie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer stared at me with a foolish expression before hastily looking at his tablet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait. I don\u2019t understand. Then why is Ace releasing these articles\u2026 Did they just make a media ploy without talking with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we did, I would have done an interview like I did for Royal Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer leaned forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen all the articles being published right now are incorrect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that was why I wanted to discuss this issue with you. I thought it would be best to act after discussing with SBE Films. Like you said, we only need to sign the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes. Wait, that\u2019s quite an upright thought, please wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>He mumbled as his eyes quickly moved in their sockets. Then he shot out of his chair. He opened the meeting room door and shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Park! Contact Ms. Minjeong from the PR Team! Quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now! It\u2019s urgent so tell her to come-! No, no! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer bolted out of the meeting room.</p><br/><p>Then, within a second, he opened the door again and stuck his head in.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoffee! I\u2019ll get you coffee so please talk with the director for a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>I saw the employees rushing about through the glass door.</p><br/><p>Turning my gaze, I looked at the middle-aged man sitting next to the producer\u2019s now empty seat.</p><br/><p>His greying hair and beard, gentle wrinkles, on the outside, he looked like a friendly neighborhood uncle, but there was no one in the film industry that didn\u2019t know his face.</p><br/><p>Choi Sungwon.</p><br/><p>He made a brilliant debut, winning the rookie director award 15 years ago. You couldn\u2019t count all the director awards he had won throughout his career with two hands, and he was the double-ten-million director having created two mega-hits that had audiences of more than 10 million people.</p><br/><p>He was one of the top directors in the nation.</p><br/><p>If Lee Songha wasn\u2019t confirmed for his next project, I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to sit in front of him and talk. And whether I properly utilized this opportunity depended on my future actions.</p><br/><p>I looked beside me. Nam Joyoon was looking at me.</p><br/><p>Even though he was suddenly brought here, he looked trustworthy.</p><br/><p>I wet my throat with the coffee an employee had brought me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something I want to talk to you about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s about PR, I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about PR but casting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, casting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an actor I would like to introduce you to.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director\u2019s gaze turned next to me. Nam Joyoon bowed as he greeted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their gazes met in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon, who looked at Nam Joyoon with an unreadable expression, asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he grouped with Ms. Lee Songha? If it\u2019s about business, why don\u2019t you try persuading the producer? It looks like you are quite helpful in promoting the film and Ms. Lee Songha is currently at the center of attention so you should come to an agreement quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is unrelated to W&amp;U. Of course, I am not trying to bring him on as an add-on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon looked like he didn\u2019t expect this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came because we didn\u2019t want to persuade a film company but you, director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I placed my hand on Nam Joyoon\u2019s shoulder and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNot with business but with acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>A phone vibrated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?! Is it Nam Joyoon, that bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no. It\u2019s Ace\u2019s Marketing Team Leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director said in a hoarse voice. Director Park vented by kicking objects in front of him. The wrecked trailer became even messier.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do? Director, are you not going to pick up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say even if I pick up! What do I say if I pick up? Do I tell him that those bastards have gone dark and I haven\u2019t said a word to them yet? Just let him be. I\u2019ll contact them once we finish talking with Nam Joyoon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park said while pacing back and forth with an anxious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain. Refresh the page again. Are there any new articles?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director picked up the tablet. His face was also stiff with nervousness. After tapping the screen with his stiff fingers a few times, he suddenly became surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are articles!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Did Jung Sunwoo, that bastard, do an interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park hastily came over.</p><br/><p>The assistant director, who had been looking at the screen with a gloomy face, slumped his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it looks like a spam article. He didn\u2019t do an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI almost had a heart attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park rubbed his chest.</p><br/><p>He slumped down on the sofa and mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bastard hasn\u2019t done an interview after going dark huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think? Even after making such a mess, he doesn\u2019t plan on seriously leaving this project.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s lips twisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dragging this on to screw me over, that shrewd bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs-is that it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf these bastards were really planning on not doing this movie, they would have already gone and talked to the reporters. Yet, they are quiet. They\u2019re saying they have the upper hand. After making me fret and fume, they will take us back once they get everything they want!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s it, then it\u2019s a relief\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a relief! When I have to bow my head at those bastards?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, a phone began vibrating again.</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s expression distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is driving me crazy. Is it Ace again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like a message. One second.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director quickly checked his phone and his eyes popped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, I found Nam Joyoon and Chief Jung Sunwoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they contact you? What did those bastards say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t contact me, but Pan Production\u2019s youngest producer contacted me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPan Production?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, apparently, they are meeting CEO Kim Pansuk right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly don\u2019t have the face to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk said with a gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>I was about to reply when the office door swung open and Director Park rushed in. It seemed he ran up the stairs as he was panting. He looked around the office, and when he spotted us, he quickly came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Park, why did you come here? You said you didn\u2019t want my measly investment?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk said with a frown.</p><br/><p>Flinching, Director Park scratched the back of his neck as he smiled gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, I will properly apologize for my words later. Like you said, I must have been crazy for a moment. I became too high strung from thinking about the project these days. I started this project with full trust in you, how could I go anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he spoke, the colder CEO Kim Pansuk\u2019s expression became.</p><br/><p>After examining his expression, Director Park coughed and looked at me like the issue with Nam Joyoon and me was more urgent. Alternating between us, he came over to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Chief Jung, why could I get a hold of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s face became rotten at my reply.</p><br/><p>If he was handed an ax, it felt like he would immediately strike my head. However, it was only for a few seconds. His face reverted to its awkward smile again. It was an uncomfortable smile, like he was wearing a mask.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course, you must have felt offended. I was very regretful when you and Mr. Joyoon left like that. No matter how much the distribution company told me to reduce Mr. Joyoon\u2019s role, as a director, I should have refused.\u201d</p><br/><p>What a joke.</p><br/><p>That was what CEO Kim Pansuk\u2019s expression read. It must be the same for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI negotiated with the company. We\u2019re going to revert Mr. Joyoon\u2019s role to how it was, no, make it even bigger. Also, it looks like my assistant director offended you and I apologize for that as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park looked at Nam Joyoon as he said this.</p><br/><p>With the same mouth he told him to not even think about acting in this industry again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Park.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are always complications while making a movie. Like how there are contractions before birth. Just consider it like we drove away bad luck and cover up what happened in the trailer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will be a little difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while getting up. Director Park\u2019s eyebrows twitched.</p><br/><p>His stabbing gaze followed my movements. Accompanied by a short click of his tongue, I heard Director Park\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came and apologized like this. Is there something else you want from me? If there is, tell me so we can come to an agreement. If we\u2019re being honest, it\u2019s not like you plan on not doing this film either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you aren\u2019t doing an interview refuting the articles and at the production company? Let\u2019s resolve what we can and do an interview together-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I picked up the trash can next to the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came here for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>I emptied the contents of the can in front of Director Park. Ripped paper piled up on his ankles.</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s expression distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wh-what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing foolishly for a moment, Director Park quickly rummaged through the paper shreds. After piecing together a few of them, his face paled. His clenched hands were trembling.</p><br/><p>He looked up to me with a face full of confusion and rage.</p><br/><p>I told him once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you that we aren\u2019t doing this movie.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> You get a stomach ache if you\u2019re jealous</p><br/><p>{TL/N: Whoops!

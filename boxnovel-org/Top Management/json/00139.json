Didn\u2019t you see the smiles hanging on the CEO and investment team leader\u2019s faces? What is it? What happened on set?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe completely entranced them as the CEO ordered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me details! Don\u2019t you know I hate being frustrated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I can\u2019t explain it with my inarticulate tongue. Just watch it on the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production producer said teasingly as he took a sip from his coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you know Chief Jung Sunwoo from W&amp;U.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung? Did he do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis actors did. That person. There really seems to be something to him seeing as he only has two actors and they\u2019re both unique. I thought Lee Songha was great, but the other one is completely-\u201c</p><br/><p>The project producer\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other one? That unknown actor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>High heels walked through the door. It was Kim Minjeong from marketing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet Chungmuro District will be in a fuss next year with all the new faces. In my opinion, someone in our movie could receive the best rookie award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the sudden name, Kang Minjeong made a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be great if both of them got an award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Nam Joyoon too? He\u2019s that good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think they\u2019ll get to walk to the podium.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production producer yawned tiredly before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless these two scenarios happen. Although it probably won\u2019t, unless our movie fails so hard it leaves a mark in history\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, geez! You\u2019re the production producer for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it probably won\u2019t. If not, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn amazing scenario and actor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong threw the stirring stick into the sink and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cSuddenly pop out of nowhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It definitely was summer. The monsoon has been going on a few days now.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader wrung his soaked sleeves as he got in the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of rain falls like there\u2019s a hole in the sky? So scary.,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a heavy rain warning in effect. They also say a hurricane is on its way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader frowned when he heard me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay when the weather\u2019s like this? Will the shoot be fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoyal Family has a lot of rainy scenes so we can film them now, but Alive is the problem. They\u2019ll probably do all the indoor scenes until the weather clears up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elevator soon arrived on the fourth floor. I was about to enter the office when the Team 3 Leader pulled in front of the vending machines.</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm, did you hear about the Team 2 Leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t been to the company recently. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s about to die of frustration.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the rookie. You know, that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSong Inho.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled his handsome face. I also recalled the scene where he looked like he was about to cry when he received the award. The scene that had been nailed to my mind and made me concerned over for the past few months.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Song Inho. The Team 2 Leader wants to make him out to be the second Sung Dowon, not personality, but image-wise. Anyways, the Team 2 Leader\u2019s been looking through drama and movie proposals when Song Inho suddenly brings over a scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A scenario?\u201d</p><br/><p>My ears perked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn independent film\u2019s scenario. It\u2019s the lead role so it\u2019ll take up a bunch of his time, and they don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ll need to film either. He clung to the Team 2 Leader\u2019s leg begging, saying that he had to do this movie. The Team 2 Leader tried to persuade him over and over but eventually gave up. He looks like he might faint from anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader chuckled as he imagined it.</p><br/><p>However, something else was filling my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, do you have the scenario?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably not? Song Inho was the one who personally brought it. Why? Are you concerned?\u201d</p><br/><p>He slapped my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Isn\u2019t Nam Joyoon already a star in the making?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said with a beaming smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard a few rumors here and there. If they are right, then he might be able to rid his label as an \u2018unknown actor\u2019 with this movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will. Not might. He will.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while suppressing the hurricane sweeping through my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 2 Leader, that fellow, snorted, laughing at how we could compare you to him. If his prided discerning eye takes a hit, his bloated ego\u2019s going to deflate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader made a satisfied smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>I bought a soda from the vending machine.</p><br/><p>My thoughts began to organize now that I had something cold in my belly.</p><br/><p>It was like the Team 3 Leader said. There was no need to worry.</p><br/><p>My team worked crazy hard for the past two months.</p><br/><p>It was just that future. It kept bugging me. So I worked harder than ever before on this project. I even needed to shorten my sleep time. Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon also worked so hard that it was a wonder they haven\u2019t collapsed yet.</p><br/><p>They also proved their hard work through their acting.</p><br/><p>Each day on set was one of admiration. I always tried to look calm because there were people around, but whenever I saw them act, I felt a surge of joy in me. There were multiple occasions where I wanted to run around the set applauding them.</p><br/><p>So\u2026</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not worry about the uncertain future that might have already been changed.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I was about to go into the office.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, hello, chief!\u201d</p><br/><p>A person who was leaning on my desk hurriedly bowed to me.</p><br/><p>It was pouring outside, yet it looked like the sun was shining around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Song Inho. We met last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded while walking casually.</p><br/><p>Honestly, taking each step was scary. I thought I would see that same future again.</p><br/><p>However, my vision didn\u2019t go dark or become hazy.</p><br/><p>I relaxed my tensed shoulders and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat brings you to Team 3?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 I wanted to meet you. About this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho showed me what was in his hand.</p><br/><p>It was a bundle of A4 paper that had been flipped through so many times the edges were worn. I knew in an instant.</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scenario of an independent film. It\u2019s the work of a director I\u2019m close with, and I\u2019m going to play the lead. That\u2019s why, if you\u2019re okay with it, I was hoping you could read this and give me your thoughts. You know, since you\u2019re famous for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho bit his lower lip before adding,</p><br/><p>\u201cI showed my team leader first, but his reaction was a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the Team 2 Leader say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn unknown director with no accomplishments, and a scenario that won\u2019t bring in investments.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019It will be very time-consuming. It is uncertain if it can even be released or not. Even if it is released, a low-budget film like this will only open in at most twenty theatres. A project that\u2019ll be considered a success if ten thousand people go watch it,\u2019 is what he said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYet you still want to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice sounded unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Song Ingo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI learned a lot from this director before I entered W&amp;U. I told him I would do his movie if he ever had a good scenario. This. He said he wrote this with me as the lead. He even but his home as collateral to make this movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho carefully smoothed out the scenario.</p><br/><p>His eyes were full of hope and happiness as he looked at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I refuse? I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho\u2019s gaze landed on me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t want to be an actor like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Ah, damn it.</p><br/><p>I want him.</p><br/><p>I exhaled what felt like cigarette smoke and put my hand out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we read it?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon opened his apartment door.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged woman entered while taking off her thick scarf. She was his mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cA hurricane came by during the summer, and now there\u2019s a crazy blizzard during the winter. We\u2019re just getting hit with everything, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call? I would have gone to pick you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my first time coming to Seoul. I can make my way through it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother scanned his dreary apartment.</p><br/><p>A clunky laptop tossed on his bed. There was a movie paused on its screen. His desk was piled with stacks of scenarios and notes. His bookcase was filled with DVD cases.</p><br/><p>After carefully examining every nook and cranny, her wrinkled face relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than before. It looks like a human\u2019s room this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon bashfully rubbed his neck.</p><br/><p>His mother walked to his fridge and put down her large luggage bag. It was filled with plastic bags full of side dishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought stir-fried anchovies, pickled garlic stems, and others. They will all last a long time in the fridge so eat up. Don\u2019t eat instant noodles, okay? Live like an actual human being.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am eating decently. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really? I can clearly tell how you live without even seeing. You incompetent son of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother said with narrowed eyes before opening his fridge.</p><br/><p>Then she paused. There were a few side dishes in containers inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? There\u2019s human food in the fridge? Where did they come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, those. Someone<sup>{1}</sup> I work with gave them to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said with a slight smile.</p><br/><p>At the same time, his mother discovered the small notes on the containers.</p><br/><p>{Eat them. Don\u2019t starve.}</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her expectant face crumbled.</p><br/><p>She jumped up and slapped his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it! How sad did you look for a man to give another man side dishes?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slaps resounded for a long time in his small apartment.</p><br/><p>After calming down, his mother said,</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, I\u2019m thankful. Bring him home one day. I\u2019ll cook meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon nodded while stealthily rubbing his back.</p><br/><p>Sitting back down in front of the fridge and placing the side dishes in the fridge, his mother asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 aren\u2019t going to do that movie you were planning on doing with that actor Jung Hyowon during the summer, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided not to a long time ago because of some circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlways with the circumstances. Why are there so many circumstances in this industry?\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother said clicking her tongue.</p><br/><p>Moving the side dish containers around in the fridge, she sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, just stay here during Lunar New Year this time. Don\u2019t come home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Nam Joyoon could reply, his mother quickly added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because we\u2019re embarrassed. It\u2019s because of your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon asked with a stiff expression.</p><br/><p>His mother hesitated, opening and closing her mouth a few times. Then she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Your father got together to drink with his siblings and made a mistake. He told them you were in a big movie. It seems he let it slip while drunk since those fellows were constantly asking what you were up to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018That idiot. Alcohol is his enemy.\u2019</p><br/><p>His mother muttered under her breath before continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you come home, they are probably going to pester you with questions and end up saying something unpleasant. There\u2019s no need to take the train all the way home to hear that. I\u2019ll pack some New Year\u2019s food for you so just stay in Seoul.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother shut the fridge door and stood up.</p><br/><p>Breaking the short silence, Nam Joyoon said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI am in a different movie. If there\u2019s no problem, it\u2019ll be released in the summer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. If you didn\u2019t have your circumstances. Which theatres are going to play it? No matter how busy we are, we should watch it as a family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time\u2026 It should be playing in theatres across the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother\u2019s eyes bulged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe country? E-even down in the countryside? All of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my goodness. Is-is it as big as the summer movie you aren\u2019t doing anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s lips opened slightly before closing.</p><br/><p>After a short moment of silence, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the movie is edited, once everything is certain\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, good. That\u2019s probably better. Don\u2019t tell your father. If he gets his hopes up and is disappo-\u201c</p><br/><p>His mother caught herself.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon lowered his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother slapped his back again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t quit this anyways, just live doing what you love. It\u2019s fine as long as you eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon smiled faintly at her blunt words.</p><br/><p>His mother rubbed his back as she grumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, I\u2019m curious what kind of movie it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>I was about to get in my minivan like normal before I stopped.</p><br/><p>The world, which had been freezing not too long ago, had begun to thaw. The people who went around huddled, fully geared in parkas and scarves, looked a bit more relaxed. Their breaths were almost invisible in the air now.</p><br/><p>My phone in my pocket vibrated. It was Team Leader Park.</p><br/><p>-Are you on your way to work?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Alive\u2019s main poster arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Royal Family\u2019s press release is also complete. We need to move at full throttle now.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime goes by very quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every day passed as a blur and finally, the time had arrived.</p><br/><p>Spring.</p><br/><p>The season of harvest.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> In the raws, he uses \u2018dongsaeng\u2019 which is a gender-neutral term for someone younger than him.</p><br/><p>{Quite a few time skips in this chapter :o}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-138\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 138\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-140\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 140\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201390\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

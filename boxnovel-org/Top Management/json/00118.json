It seemed like he would bring up something regarding Park Dojin or Lee Songha. I did my best to prepare for whatever question he would ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m 28.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s young. Any hobbies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like watching movies and dramas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was he suddenly asking about my life?</p><br/><p>He asked me a few more random questions afterwards. CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s voice and demeanor were always calm. Yet, I answered with a straight back because he still gave off an imposing feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you golf?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I have never tried it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019ll introduce you to someone so try learning it. It\u2019s good if you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then of course I had to learn it. I had to go even if I didn\u2019t have enough time to sleep or eat.</p><br/><p>Bowing, I readily accepted his offer. Having already heard that those who held high positions in broadcasting companies and agencies discussed important details on the golf course, I had planned on learning it in the future anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you refused to transfer to Team 2?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this was the main topic, I clenched my clasped hands once before replying,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting if you don\u2019t get along with your superiors. That\u2019s also why I became independent.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something I hadn\u2019t heard from his interviews.</p><br/><p>\u201cI plan to divide the Management Business Department even further in a few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be new teams. The number of team leaders will increase as well. I\u2019ve been observing a few experienced chiefs to develop into team leaders rather than selecting people externally. Someone who is well-connected. Someone who does his job well. And\u2026 Someone with skill and knows how to make deals.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded my head as I listened when CEO Baek Hansung didn\u2019t hesitate as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do as you have been. Then I\u2019ll give you a team of your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Give me what?</p><br/><p>The answers I had prepared in my mind were swept away. I forgot to maintain my calm, relaxed expression as I looked at CEO Baek Hansung with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy own team?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, your team.\u201d</p><br/><p>I went to the washroom as soon as I exited his office. I held onto the sink as I let out the breath I had been holding in. I vaguely remembered that CEO Baek Hansung talked about a lot of things including Lee Songha, but there was only one thing that filled my head.</p><br/><p>My own team.</p><br/><p>My team composed of my actors, my celebrities, and my people.</p><br/><p>It was like a magic word. Just thinking about it made it hard to breathe as though I had just sprinted at full speed.</p><br/><p>I felt proud and moved when I received my business card with the position \u2018Chief\u2019 written on it, but the position \u2018Team Leader\u2019 was one that felt incomparably distant to that of a chief, especially with my current experience.</p><br/><p>Get it together.</p><br/><p>I washed my hands with cold water and slapped my cheeks a few times.</p><br/><p>Just as I saw my dazed face reflected in the mirror, I felt like I stumbled and the world became black.</p><br/><p>I was sitting in a plush chair that seemed to bury me in its cushions.</p><br/><p>I was wearing an expensive suit and had my legs crossed with my hands clasped on top of my knee. My clear vision felt unfamiliar. So it was that. My fixed future. The future where I was the CEO of a management company.</p><br/><p>How long had it been?</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that W&amp;U\u2019s CEO Baek Hansung was your role model in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard a woman\u2019s cautious voice.</p><br/><p>My vision swayed and I saw the two women sitting across the table.</p><br/><p>They were Reporter Song and Reporter Park, no, Director Park.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d</p><br/><p>My future self replied. It was moderately smooth and leisurely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never met him before so I\u2019m curious what kind of person he was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park seemed to reminisce the past as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was one of the main role models of young people working in the management business. He was a self-made man who made his 1-person company into a major one within ten years. The press loved him since he was a successful young businessman. Now that I think about it, CEO Jung seems quite a bit similar to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s black lips curved upwards. I tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you both have numerous similar traits. Ah, besides your impression.\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly recalled CEO Baek Hansung, who I had met in his office moments ago. My future self was similar to him? This perked my curiosity. I glanced around to see if I could see myself reflected on something.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why did you storm out of your role model\u2019s company?\u201d</p><br/><p>Storm out?</p><br/><p>I was surprised for a moment, but when I thought about it, it was obvious. I had to have left W&amp;U to establish my own company and become a CEO. But to say I stormed out rather than I left gave me a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>My future self replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like his methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis methods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was young then so I must have become disillusioned while observing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt disillusioned by CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s methods?</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t even begin to guess what had happened. I didn\u2019t even know if something like that would occur or not.</p><br/><p>I had already changed the present so much. The situation I was currently in compared to six months ago, and even I had changed immensely as well.</p><br/><p>The Jung Sunwoo being interviewed right now was \u2018W&amp;U\u2019s Lucky Charm\u2019, didn\u2019t become a chief at 28, and definitely wasn\u2019t told that he would be given his own team by CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>Director Park joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou regretted it after pompously leaving W&amp;U, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>My future self said with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have grown much more quickly if I had continued to work under CEO Baek. After leaving, I realized the cold hard truth. That this industry was filled with so many people who were black to their stomachs that CEO Baek was considered grey.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was he saying?</p><br/><p>It seemed like I wasn\u2019t the only confused as Reporter Song asked instead</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you by grey?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then and even now, this place known as the entertainment world dyes people black. The higher up you go, the harder it is to endure while staying white. But if you become too black, then you become trash like the Pure Star people. It\u2019s really difficult trying to stay grey amongst them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then are you currently grey?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt the muscles near my lips move subtly.</p><br/><p>Then, with a low laugh, my future self said,</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><br/><p>A drop of water ran down my cheek and dripped from my chin.</p><br/><p>When I came to my senses, I was looking at my face reflected in the mirror.</p><br/><p>I was back in the present.</p><br/><p>I turned on the cold water, washed my face, and brushed my wet hair to the side. The future was odd the more I thought about it. The futures I had seen were always inhospitable, but they seemed like they wanted to tell me something. This time, it was ambiguous.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it intently for a bit before stopping.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t plan on storming out of the company right now anyways.</p><br/><p>Like what my future self said, staying in W&amp;U would allow me to become more successful more quickly than suffering on my own. This was also one of my new goals after I started changing my future.</p><br/><p>Only, a single sprout of doubt budded in my mind.</p><br/><p>My future self. What kind of person was I 20 years in the future?</p><br/><p>I became curious about that.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I pressed the code in the keypad and opened the front door.</p><br/><p>It opened a few centimeters before halting with a thud. There was a chain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it? If it\u2019s Sunwoo oppa, tell us your nickname. Snake, snake, what kind of snake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop speaking nonsense and open the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung opened the door wide with smiling eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t trailed by reporters, right? There aren\u2019t any reporters outside, right? You have to be careful. If you slip up, the paparazzi might snap of picture of you. We\u2019re now a girl group whose every move is newsworthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have full makeup on in case someone takes a picture of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy naked face is drab because I couldn\u2019t sleep due to our busy schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then pouted her glossy lips.</p><br/><p>I looked at the other girls. Lee Taehee was slumped on the sofa, uncertain whether she was alive or dead, like always, and LJ was doing sit-ups on the floor next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe tried to stop her as much as we could.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said while wiping the sweat from her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being such a pain. Dummy, who\u2019s curious about your every move? The only one among us that paparazzi will follow is Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, one person was missing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut where is Songha? Did she leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room. She was going in and out of it just moments ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe somehow always knew when you were coming so she\u2019d be out here watching the front door, but why is she so quiet today? Hey, Lee Son-!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Im Seoyoung opened her door, a sound of something breaking resounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, what the heck? Are you okay? So-sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha rubbed her forehead as she walked out. Her forehead was red.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t seem fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you doing standing behind your door?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was on my way out.\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied as she glanced in my direction.</p><br/><p>She opened and closed her mouth a few times before firmly keeping it shut. She tottered out and took out a bucket of ice cream with her name written on it from the freezer. Then she crouched down next to the sofa and began eating it.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee moved her arm to stroke Lee Songha\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s acting like that because she\u2019s stressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung said as she shook my arm. Lee Songha bluntly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m eating it because I want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell you are! Do you know how many meals you had since the scandal broke out? Yesterday and the day before, you ordered three night time meals instead of sleeping!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked, everyone besides Lee Songha nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t sleep a wink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t care much when the scandal with the Punchline member broke out, but this time, it like the world\u2019s ending. She would lie in the living room early in the morning, mumbling, \u2018dummy, dummy,\u2019 she\u2019s like a haunting spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ and Im Seoyoung clicked their tongues and said in a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee got up from the sofa, came over, and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Songha\u2019s manager might change because of the scandal, when will it be decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt already has been.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s shoulders flinched.</p><br/><p>Eyes wide, the girls asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s going to happen? Of course, I\u2019m still going to be assigned to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha turned her head so quickly that I could almost hear the wind.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were wide like she couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. Her lips were slightly apart. She hastily abandoned the ice cream bucket and spoon she was hugging and came over to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo-how?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I had a plan and to leave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I had been slightly uneasy, but I didn\u2019t show it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI personally heard the CEO\u2019s response. Even in the future, you are an actress under my care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour actress\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Color flushed on her pale white face.</p><br/><p>Her eyes curved and her firmly shut lips squirmed upwards. I suddenly recalled what Im Seoyoung had said. Her expression was exactly that of someone who heard that the world wouldn\u2019t be collapsing after they had been preparing for it.</p><br/><p>Also, she looked at me like I had somehow saved the world.</p><br/><p>It was an incredible expression. If this was a scene in a drama or movie, I would have immediately screen-captured it and used it as my laptop and phone\u2019s backgrounds.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, I recalled something I had to ask her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, I have something I want to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ask me anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe picture you mentioned.\u201d</p><br/><p>The color drained from her face.</p><br/><p>Avoiding the gazes of the other girls, we entered Lee Songha\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha resembled someone who was going to the guillotine.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, so you touched my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018I think so\u2019? Why did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced at my expression before gulping and saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was out of impulse. It was night, you were sleeping, and for some reason, I was curious about it that night. I wasn\u2019t in my right mind. That momentary impulse beat out my reasoning and lead to me doing that. I looked it up on the internet and apparently, this occasionally happens due to hormones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHormones?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s all because of hormones.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at her with a dumbfounded expression, and she, who pushed her hormone-driven impulse story, avoided my gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough it\u2019s because of my hormones, I am very sorry for molesting you. You can touch my face if you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t say that anywhere else. It\u2019ll cause a huge fuss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>I rubbed my chin a couple times before asking again,</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you did was touch my face and put your finger in my mouth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw the pictures in the CEO\u2019s possession.\u201d</p><br/><p>She flinched. She definitely flinched just now.</p><br/><p>I was waiting for her to confess on her own after taking the bait, but Lee Songha kept her lips firmly shut before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s true. That\u2019s really all.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t fall for it.</p><br/><p>I let out a short breath while asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha. You know, do you really not li-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha shouted, cutting me off. She even shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was quite serious. No, it wasn\u2019t just her voice, her expression was as well.</p><br/><p>The way she looked directly at me was also serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to like anyone and just work. I\u2019m not going to date until I become successful enough to take responsibility. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha seemingly vowed before taking steadfast steps to her bed. She then quickly jumped into her sheets.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to sleep now. Have a safe trip back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay, rest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>I came out to the living room as though I was repelled by something.</p><br/><p>Even though I clearly asked her and heard her reply, my head was slightly complicated.</p><br/><p>I decided to think about it on my way back and said my farewell to the girls. The girls saw me off at the entrance as usual. Looking around, Im Seoyoung tilted her head and shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha! Oppa\u2019s leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls blinked when they heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep when you\u2019re leaving? She is? The one who always sticks next to you? What the heck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said she didn\u2019t sleep for two days. Don\u2019t wake her up and let her be.\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved and left their home.</p><br/><p>I continuously thought about it until I got in my minivan. My emotions were all over the place. Should I say I was relieved yet disappointed? Distracted?</p><br/><p>I glanced up the apartment building before clicking my tongue and starting my car.</p><br/><p>It seemed that my hormones were running amok today as well.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>As soon as it became quiet outside her room, Lee Songha kicked away her blanket and jolted up. Then she propped her chin on her window and looked down.</p><br/><p>She saw a minivan parked under the streetlights.</p><br/><p>The entrance lights turned on and she saw a familiar head.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha quietly looked out her window until the minivan grew so distant that she could no longer see it in the darkness.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-117\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 117\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-119\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 119\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201349\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

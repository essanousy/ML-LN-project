How dare they-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyes blazing, Director Park puffed his cigarette. An unpleasant smoke dispersed in the air. He looked around for an ashtray, but all he saw was the broken furniture, the aftermath of the havoc. Surging in rage again, Director Park chucked his cigarette stub away.</p><br/><p>Just then, his phone, which had tumbled underneath the sofa, began to vibrate. Seeing the caller, Director Park\u2019s expression distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what is-\u201c</p><br/><p>-I got a call from Mr. Sunwoo. I heard you decided to break Nam Joyoon\u2019s contract!</p><br/><p>Pan Production\u2019s CEO, Kim Pansuk, shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it. After causing trouble here, he tattled to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Director Park, you eventually-!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. I tried to keep Nam Joyoon since you said we could never cut him from the film, but they were the ones who kicked this film away and left! I\u2019m the one who\u2019s pissed!\u201d</p><br/><p>-Mr. Sunwoo isn\u2019t someone who would act like that. Just how badly did you treat Nam Joyoon for-! How can I see Mr. Sunwoo\u2019s face in the future?!</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s lips twisted.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019ll try talking with Mr. Sunwoo again, so you-!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, geez, you\u2019re going to yell my ears off. Stop interfering.\u201d</p><br/><p>-\u2026 What did you say?</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t what happens on set the director\u2019s jurisdiction? I endured it all this time because you let me produce my film just from looking at my scenario when I was down in the dumps, but you\u2019re going too far. This is a ten billion won movie! A ten billion!\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk\u2019s voice cut off.</p><br/><p>A heavy sigh broke the silence. Kim Pansuk said in a persuading tone.</p><br/><p>-Director Park, you\u2019re making a big mistake right now. You\u2019re blinded by the ten billion won. If you keep going like this, the mood on set will be a mess and your scenario will in tatters in the distributor\u2019s hands!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you wary of the Ace Distribution Company?\u201d</p><br/><p>-What?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they introduced me to big investors and the budget increased a ton, are you worried that Pan Production won\u2019t get as big of a cut?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk\u2019s breaths became rough at Director Park\u2019s mocking words.</p><br/><p>-\u2026 They say you can see the deep into the water but you can\u2019t fathom a person\u2019s heart. I\u2019m taking my investment out and let go so go find another production company!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo that then. The loss of a few billion won doesn\u2019t even tickle me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crazy bastard.</p><br/><p>Holding those two words back, CEO Kim Pansuk hung up.</p><br/><p>The trailer became quiet once more. Director Park slumped into the sofa and rubbed his cut lower lip. He held another cigarette in his mouth. After inhaling a couple times, Director Park called someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, team leader. About what we talked about before. About Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, that. How did it go?</p><br/><p>The voice on the other side nonchalantly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bastard decided to get out of the project completely. Once we reduced his role and showed him who\u2019s boss on set, he couldn\u2019t endure it and scrammed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park tapped his cigarette ash without care and perked his ears. He didn\u2019t hear a reaction, but the slow breathing sound that sounded out had traces of satisfaction.</p><br/><p>-Really? I thought he was the type who wouldn\u2019t give up since he was doing independent films for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s good at acting so if he did well, he might have shined eventually, but his temper is trash. That bastard is never going to be successful. You not signing him was a great decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>After shamelessly flattering him for a while, Director Park added,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung Sunwoo came over and the two of them wrecked havoc before leaving, That man\u2019s a crazy one too.\u201d</p><br/><p>-\u2026 Really? That must have been quite a sight.</p><br/><p>A low laughter rang from the other side.</p><br/><p>Just as Director Park opened his mouth to say something-</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! Someone came to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director knocked on the trailer door.</p><br/><p>Director Park pulled his phone back and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, he\u2019s a reporter? He wanted to see the film set and interview you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing it was a reporter, Director Park\u2019s eyes bulged.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll be there in a sec!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouting that, Director Park took out his phone away and went straight to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, umm, team leader, now that the troublesome problem has been settled, if this project is a hit, I am planning on a large-scale blockbuster for my next project. I already have a scenario. If I could cast a top star like Mr. Seo Jijoon or Ms. Son Chaeyoung\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-Let\u2019s see the scenario then.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park bowed to the air.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, he hummed as he stood in front of the mirror on the wall. His brightly smiling face was reflected on the shattered mirror. He straightened his back and tidied his tangled hair.</p><br/><p>The door to his trailer shook again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! Director! Please hurry up and come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs usual, you\u2019re always lacking\u2026 I\u2019m coming out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park swung open his trailer door.</p><br/><p>He saw three reporters carrying laptop bags and cameras behind the assistant director.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Entertainment Movie, are you the director?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct. If you let us know ahead of time, we could have prepa-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for coming suddenly, but would an interview be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, of course. If it\u2019s going to promote my project, of course, I have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park replied with a smile when questions began pouring in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your relationship with W&amp;U\u2019s Mr. Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Mr. Jung Sunwoo contact you first after seeing your scenario?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the actor in Mr. Jung Sunwoo\u2019s care? I heard he\u2019s an unknown rookie, could we hold a joint interview with him as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dumfounded, Director Park stumbled backward. Beside him, the assistant director was blinking with the same expression. The film crew and extras began to gather one by one.</p><br/><p>The reporters stuck to Director Park.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, please give us your comment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople all around call Mr. Jung Sunwoo Midas\u2019s Hand, and the projects he chooses garner significant interest because of him. Everyone working on the movie must be really grateful to Mr. Jung Sunwoo, how do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould a joint interview with Mr. Jung Sunwoo be difficult?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park flinched in surprise. The phone in his hand was vibrating.</p><br/><p>The caller was Ace Distribution Company.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>A sleek, foreign car rolled into the parking lot.</p><br/><p>Director Park swallowed his saliva. Two men in suits got out of the car. They were the Film Business General Manager, who made his film a ten-billion won project, and the marketing team leader.</p><br/><p>The general manager approached him with a broad smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Park, why didn\u2019t you let us in on such important news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 General manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had such a good asset like him, you should have immediately told the marketing team. Don\u2019t you know how much Royal Family benefited from using Mr. Jung Sunwoo? Team Leader Lee, we can get as much as them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, in fact, the timing is better for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The marketing team leader laughed while waving his tablet.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Cat Guardian Ghost and Lee Songha became huge hits in China, there\u2019s a ton of attention on Chief Jung Sunwoo for bringing someone to international stardom. On top of that, our associates are all in China so reporters are in a frenzy. Whatever we say now will be trending.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI gave some comments to reporters, and their reactions were very heated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet the investors must be enticed as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. They are already nibbling the bait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good. Director Park!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, general manager. But, umm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you are busy filming, please cooperate with us. If we are able to promote properly and save on marketing costs from the beginning, all of it will go to the production budget. Team Leader Lee, what did you say you needed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we need to hold an interview with Chief Jung Sunwoo and the director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said Chief Jung Sunwoo did interviews for Royal Family, right? Ask him about it. He gets to promote his unknown rookie as well. Since it\u2019s a win-win situation for all parties, why would he decline? Let\u2019s work on this later. Director Park, there is no problem with doing an interview, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a little\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The general manager stared at Director Park.</p><br/><p>Director Park smiled awkwardly as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The untouched coffee had become cold.</p><br/><p>Having explained what had occurred a few hours prior, Director Park examined the faces of those in front of him. The general manager and team leader were whispering to each other with serious expressions for a while now. Comforting his parched throat, Director Park gulped down his cold coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park spat his coffee at the sudden words.</p><br/><p>\u201cPa-pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Nam Joyoon, bring him back at all costs. Whether we double his contract or give him a bigger role, spare no cost in comforting Mr. Nam Joyoon and Mr. Jung Sunwoo and get them to do the movie again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team leader said. His voice and expression were incomparably serious.</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Director Park hesitated in his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, do we really hav-! Did Ace want to take Nam Joyoon out-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was before this situation broke out. Do you know how many articles about this are being published? If you don\u2019t bring Mr. Nam Joyoon back, things might take an extreme turn for the worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just explain to the press? That there was misinformation-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen they are publishing articles about Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019s choice and stuff, do you think we\u2019ll be able to handle to aftermath if we tell them it\u2019s not? Above all, it\u2019s not like Mr. Nam Joyoon left on good terms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team leader frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Chief Jung Sunwoo does something crazy like saying he pulled out because he thought this movie would flop, the press will have a field day with that. Then do you think the investors will sit still?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Midas\u2019s Hand and all that, that\u2019s all because he\u2019s lucky. Who really believes that? We all know that the reporters are joking when they say that. Don\u2019t tell me that investors will-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Park.\u201d</p><br/><p>The general manager cut in with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo people who invested tens of billions of won, this isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Nam Joyoon and Mr. Jung Sunwoo. Bring them back no matter what. If you can\u2019t do it, ask CEO Kim Pansuk of Pan Production. Since they worked on Cat Guardian Ghost together, they should be quite close.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s complexion became gloomy.</p><br/><p>The general manager issued an ultimatum.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove quickly. If things don\u2019t work out and the investors pull out, we will have no choice but to take our hands off this project as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThe weather\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said, looking at the blue sky out the window.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon stared at me. His jaw was locked for a while now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep getting calls. The director, assistant director\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already received more than 40 texts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the incident has become too big of a deal. Same with the reporters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it should when I worked so hard to fan the flames.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while looking down at my vibrating phone.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s phone wasn\u2019t the only one going crazy. My phone was too. In fact, I was even contacted by people in China, saying things like \u2018You said you were going to quietly take care of business and come back, but how is this quiet?\u2019 or \u2018Why do you start up a storm wherever you go?\u2019</p><br/><p>Though missed calls and texts were piling up like crazy, I let it be.</p><br/><p>I only made a couple important calls.</p><br/><p>I took out two cans I bought from the convenience store and handed one to Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust relax and wait while drinking soda.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it okay to just stay like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reporters are in a frenzy so doing nothing is actually better for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon let out a sigh. Then he rested his head on the headrest and opened the can. I lightly clinked my can with his and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about how far I should go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>A cloud slowly rolled in the blue sky.</p><br/><p>A mild early summer breeze blew in through the half-opened window.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I stop at a good place or go all the way?\u201d</p><br/><p>I mumbled, closing my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to know this once I entered this industry, but it seems I\u2019m the type to hold grudges.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lazily opened one eye and saw Nam Joyoon\u2019s dumbfounded face.</p><br/><p>The corners of my lips unconsciously rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep wanting to go all the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, Nam Joyoon, this guy, isn\u2019t answering his phone? Wh-what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what do we do? Keep calling him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park and the assistant director\u2019s urgent voices rang out.</p><br/><p>Their expressions were more of a mess than the trailer.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing as he isn\u2019t answering even when I use a different phone, it looks like this bastard went dark! Chief Jung Sunwoo isn\u2019t answering either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you send him a message? About talking in person? You brought up his contract money as well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I did all of that! He ignored all of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherfucker, fuck! Damn it! The news had to break out at a time like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park swore.</p><br/><p>Pressing his phone on his ear, the assistant director asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do if Nam Joyoon doesn\u2019t come back? Director, won\u2019t our film get canceled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jinx it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park rubbed his anxious face. Then he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we lower our heads first by saying him we\u2019ll revert his role back and forget what happened in the trailer, they\u2019ll follow suit and won\u2019t take it too far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWi-will they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo, that bastard. He has no choice if he thinks about Nam Joyoon\u2019s acting career. It\u2019s a significant role in a ten-billion won movie. If he doesn\u2019t come back, where will Nam Joyoon go? Will there be a director that\u2019ll give Nam Joyoon better conditions than me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Hanging up, I got back in the minivan.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon, who was looking at the sunset with a complicated expression, turned his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I came because of a meeting. I\u2019ve been mediating a movie on top of Royal Family for Songha. A 34-billion-won blockbuster. They\u2019ve been dragging it on for a while, but now that her popularity has surged as an international star, I think we\u2019ll sign soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then I\u2019ll get off here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped Nam Joyoon just as he grabbed the handle.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Starting the minivan, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead of a 10-billion-won film, I\u2019m going to try and get you a 34-billion-won one.\u201d</p><br/><p>{TL/N: We\u2019re seeing Jung Sunwoo take action! <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude2e\" class=\"emoji\" draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/1f62e.svg\"/> }</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-130\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 130\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-132\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 132\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201374\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

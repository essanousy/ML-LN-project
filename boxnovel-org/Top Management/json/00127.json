The two were still grabbing each other\u2019s hair and collars.</p><br/><p>They won\u2019t ignore the director\u2019s signal, will they? They\u2019ll let go soon. Of course, they will.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you two not hear him? Why aren\u2019t they coming out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they are still grabbing at each other\u2019s collars?? Why are they like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t let go.</p><br/><p>What a mess. Damn it, damn it. What should I say to the staff?</p><br/><p>\u2018Korean stars A and B got in a real fight during an adlib scene.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just as this tabloid headline struck my mind, Lee Songha and Son Chaeyoung let go of each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh- Ah, thank you for your hard work. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was first to bow to the staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t hear the signal. Water got in my ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said after.</p><br/><p>The staff surrounded them as soon as they go out of the pool.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! This scene was amazing! It was the best adlib ever!\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t adlibbing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I knew you were acting, my heart was pounding.\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t acting either.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think people will go crazy if we make a promotional clip out of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s tell them that this was an ad-libbed scene at the end and word it this way, \u2018They are real actresses! This is what adlib is! This is what professionalism looks like!\u2019</p><br/><p>Bullshit!</p><br/><p>I barely managed to swallow the word that had crawled up my throat.</p><br/><p>Anyways, it was great that we were done. Holding my chest, I was about to go to Lee Songha, but people blocked my path. They were Director Woo, the production producer, and other production staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Woo\u2019s face was red. I felt steam would rise from his head if we opened its top. Why was this man so excited? It was my first time seeing him push forward like a bulldozer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you decide on a next project? Do another one with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha? Today\u2019s the first Royal Family shoot, why are you asking about her next project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that she\u2019s an international star, she\u2019ll receive a ton of great projects from now on, right?! That\u2019s why I need to get a head start. Ms. Lee Songha and Ms. Son Chaeyoung, let\u2019s do a project with them as leads. The chemistry between the two is too good to end it with this cameo appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>What chemistry?</p><br/><p>At a loss for words, I laughed. The Well-Made Production producer talked this time.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were lit with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cA movie, how about a movie? The Chungmuro International Film Festival is a complete sausage fest these days, a two female lead project will be fresh. With those two, if we grease up the investors a little, investments will pour in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAction! How about an action flick? If their acting can be this vigorous, I think they\u2019ll be able to do action scenes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea! Let\u2019s produce an amazing project and aim for the Cannes Film Festival!\u201d</p><br/><p>Put it away.</p><br/><p>Dramas, movies, and the Cannes Film Festival.</p><br/><p>If you left those two together for more than a day, where you\u2019ll be headed won\u2019t be the Cannes Film Festival but the police station or emergency hospital.</p><br/><p>I will reject this from now on. My stomach ached just from putting them together for a cameo scene, to work on a project together for months? I would get holes in my stomach. So many that it would look like a beehive.</p><br/><p>With the smile of a capitalist, I replied to Director Woo and the production producer, who were each holding one of my arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. If you have a good script or scenario, please show me any time. It\u2019s too early to decide on her next project right now, and it\u2019ll be difficult to come up with a schedule that\u2019ll work with both of them. I will talk about this as positively as I can with Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, chief!\u201d</p><br/><p>No need for thanks.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t happen anyways.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>As soon as I entered the hotel restaurant with Neptune, people\u2019s gazes landed on us.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact we were quite a bit away from other people as our table was surrounded by other reserved tables, people stopped butting and stared at us, especially Lee Songha. Their butts lifted up and down as they wanted to get closer to us.</p><br/><p>The hotel didn\u2019t allow autographs and photos for our convenience and safety, but it seemed like we would be crowded with people already.</p><br/><p>They looked like they were dying to hear what we were talking about.</p><br/><p>It was better if they didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Hey, you really fought with Son Chaeyoung? During a shoot?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what they were talking about.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee held Lee Songha\u2019s chin and turned her head left and right. Even though she seemed disinterested in everything, she was a leader who would take charge when it came to her members. Even now, there was a slight frown on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, let\u2019s see your face. Are you hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. Only a few hairs were pulled out. And water in my ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really pulled her hair and fought? I heard it was no joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t pull her hair,\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha brazenly said.</p><br/><p>Yup, she didn\u2019t pull her hair. Instead, she grabbed her head and neck.</p><br/><p>When I stared at her with crossed arms, Lee Songha stealthily avoided my gaze.</p><br/><p>As if parched, Im Seoyoung downed her water in one go.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, you fought against that witch, right? Who won? Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I think I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! I was thinking about getting LJ to tackle her in a pinch, but good job!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I a pokemon, dummy?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ hit the back of Im Seoyoung\u2019s head and asked Lee Songha again,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really won?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI kept losing, but I think I won at the end. I won.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked proud.</p><br/><p>She was like this for a while like an animal that had fought and beat a challenger in her territory. She proudly puffed her chest while occasionally glancing at me with glittering eyes. Was a spoil of war?</p><br/><p>And who won? No matter who saw it, it was a draw.</p><br/><p>Right, now that I thought about it, I had something I wanted to ask her if I got the chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, I have something I\u2019m curious about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, oppa. What is it? Ask me anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring the shoot, what did Son Chaeyoung whisper in your ear?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did she say for a fight to break out right after?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha fiddled with her glass of water and avoided my gaze again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said I could ask you anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly that\u2019s a secret. There are reasons why I can\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm, so it\u2019s a secret?</p><br/><p>I recalled the first day the quadruplets lied to me.</p><br/><p>I leaned towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust tell me a little. I\u2019ll forget it as soon as I hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I can\u2019t. Especially to you, I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That makes me more curious.</p><br/><p>Curling the corners of lips into a smile, I asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say it, especially to me? That makes me sad. Why? Will I be angry if you told me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no. That\u2019s not it. It\u2019s actually-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSnake!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Lee Songha was about to open her coral lips, Im Seoyoung suddenly waved a napkin in front of my face,</p><br/><p>Like a matador but calling out to a snake instead of a bull.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnake! Snake! There\u2019s a snake here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could there be a snake here? People are going to be in a frenzy if they hear you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the snake! Oh my god! What in the world! Snakes like you got Eve to eat the apple! By slowly tempting her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of nonsense is that? But were you Christian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Im Seoyoung placed and pushed the napkin on my face, LJ clicked her tongue and said to Lee Songha,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who said it was a secret, yet you were getting sweet-talked in ten seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even aware of it. My mind turned blank for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re out of energy. Eat this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee gave her sweet ginseng jelly. Never one to refuse food, Lee Songha opened one up and tossed it into her mouth while still avoiding my gaze.</p><br/><p>Should I wait for another chance when the other girls were away?</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this, LJ gave me a sneaky look.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, you were a harmless snake, but after shedding your skin a couple times\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A couple times?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re becoming an Asian tiger snake<sup>{1}</sup>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlossing over the snake part, why, from all the species of snakes, am I an Asian tiger snake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? Do you know how fatal their venom is? Hiding your schemes with a smiling face makes it seem like you\u2019re becoming more like CEO Baek Hansung as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else stared at me when they heard her words.</p><br/><p>Sliding her slender finger along the blade of a knife, LJ added,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t become too much like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to open my mouth to reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then I turned around, I saw an unexpected person.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo glance at the Neptune members before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk. In private.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she said \u2018in private\u2019, I thought it would only be the two of us, but her two managers followed behind her. Maybe it was because they were conscious of other people\u2019s gazes, but their expressions didn\u2019t seem dangerous, only it was clear they didn\u2019t have a good impression of me.</p><br/><p>What was this now?</p><br/><p>It was my first time in a situation like this since graduating high school.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no need to go far. Let\u2019s just talk here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said, stopping in a place where I could still see the restaurant entrance.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo calculated the distance between the people in the restaurant and us. Having concluded that they most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to hear them, she then opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that I said some things in front of Son Chaeyoung sunbae when I was drunk, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she remember?</p><br/><p>Since what I said wasn\u2019t wrong, I comfortably replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow ridiculous. Hey, look here. How dare you just watch it happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m making mistakes while drunk, isn\u2019t it good manners to try to stop me, call my managers, or settle the situation somehow?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Good manners?</p><br/><p>Even amongst all the nonsense I\u2019ve heard, this took the cake. Who was she to talk about manners?</p><br/><p>\u201cI did try to stop you, I did, but you wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I also didn\u2019t know the chief in charge of you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s team leader. Not chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>The weasel standing to the right of Seo Eunkyo cut in.</p><br/><p>Was he a team leader? I guess I was mistaken since this trip to China was my first time meeting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I heard, your manners are a bit lacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said. He\u2019s completely different from his image on TV. They must have edited and broadcasted him acting all innocent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, boy.</p><br/><p>I was already at a loss for words from what he said, but Seo Eunkyo took it a step further.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t try to stop me but just watched in delight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t have a good impression of me as well! Since I said some mean things to Lee Songha as her sunbae! So I\u2019m asking if you just watched to screw me over! All happy inside! Right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, if Seo Eunkyo really did say those things to Son Chaeyoung instead of me, then I obviously would have watched in delight. But since that didn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean no?! I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you should have stopped me! How can I meet Chaeyoung sunbae now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer seemed to be already decided, and they just wanted me to admit it.</p><br/><p>She said she wanted to talk, yet why were they picking a fight as a group?</p><br/><p>Her relationship with Son Chaeyoung was screwed, her first shoot was a mess, and Lee Songha, who she disliked, was applauded by the director and the staff.</p><br/><p>Was that why she was venting to me? Since Lee Songha barely reacted when she bullied her, was she trying to bully me, her manager, and soothe her temper?</p><br/><p>I frowned before relaxing.</p><br/><p>From afar, Lee Songha and the other girls were staring at us with lit eyes. They looked like they would come over holding knives and forks if I had a bad expression.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t let them do that.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo was weak to the strong and strong to the weak. Maybe if it was Son Chaeyoung or Seo Jijoon, who were considered bigger stars than her, but if they came over and joined the fight, there would be no way Seo Eunkyo would back down.</p><br/><p>Instead, she might even yammer away more excitedly. There was no need for more people to be involved in this mess.</p><br/><p>I forced a calm expression and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you can read minds, but there\u2019s nothing more I can say if you keep saying that I did when I told you I didn\u2019t. What is it that you want from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s partly your fault, you take responsibility! What are you going to do about this situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell it is.</p><br/><p>Looking at them, they were the type of people who would make you bow lower if you bowed down even once.</p><br/><p>Since human words didn\u2019t work, I guess I needed to bark too.</p><br/><p>\u201cResponsibility? Me? Why would I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re venting the fact that you screwed up your dear relationship with Ms. Son Chaeyoung, but if you\u2019re angry, don\u2019t vent on someone else, and instead, just drink some more. Ah, is alcohol too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really! Absurd! Who do you think you are?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who finds this absurd is me. It\u2019s best if you lower your voice. Nothing good will come out of others hearing you. Anyways, if it\u2019s something regarding Ms. Son Chaeyoung, I had no confidence or methods in taking responsibility. Go to her personally and settle this yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou f-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, Eunkyo. People are watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>The weasel, who called himself a team leader, stopped Seo Eunkyo, who was pointed at me in agitation.</p><br/><p>Then he took a step forward and scanned me with his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Jung Sunwoo, it hasn\u2019t been a year since you\u2019ve started, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>What the heck? Was it his turn now?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019re still na\u00efve to the ways of the world, but you can\u2019t continue as a manager for long if you keep acting this way. If you plan on quitting after a bit, then keep acting that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing as he didn\u2019t plan on stopping his nonsense-spouting celebrity, I could tell they were all the same. At a loss for words, I could help but laugh at seeing Seo Eunkyo\u2019s triumphant expression behind her team leader and chief.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of my own business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can. Mr. Jung Sunwoo, there are quite a few unpleasant rumors about you. There are also people who don\u2019t have a good impression of you either. People around you smile since you\u2019re on a roll and everything you do is a success, but what are you going to do once you slip up? I understand that you\u2019re young, hot-blooded, and stubborn, but I\u2019m worried about your future as a sunbae in the same industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll take care of my own business. My sunbae will worry about my future so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are frustrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you that he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>And how much have you seen me?</p><br/><p>I was more dumbfounded by the chief who supported the weasel team leader.</p><br/><p>The world was vast and there were many crazies. How many were there for three of them to group up like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do they teach you in your company? Is there no sunbae that teaches you things like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about a sunbae?\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice, dripping with irritation, suddenly sounded out behind me.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, Kim Hyunjo and Lee Kwanwoo were making their way here.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo\u2019s thick dark circles reached his chin from how busy he was in China, making his face look incomparably spooky. Behind him Lee Kwanwoo was anxiously moving his eyes, a shame considering his large build.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to watch a little longer, but it seems you were talking about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re Chief Kim Hyunjo, right? There was a problem with how he was working-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cSo nosy. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so concerned about what a company is teaching its employees.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to concern myself if your company\u2019s affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI taught him, so what? What\u2019s wrong with him? If I were to compare him with those trash-like managers I\u2019ve seen until now, he\u2019s pretty much a masterpiece.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said while tapping my shoulder.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo snorted as she joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat masterpiece? Does your company not teach their people about having an upright character?\u201d</p><br/><p>To hear the words \u2018upright character\u2019 from her mouth, I felt like it was just dirtying the word.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. You should teach your employees prope-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo, who was raising her voice, suddenly flinched. Then she looked behind me with round eyes. Her petty team leader and chief were also looking in the same place with flustered expressions.</p><br/><p>I could tell without looking.</p><br/><p>People\u2019s murmurs grew louder. I heard girls\u2019 suppressed screams, and above all, when I talked to him on the phone before, Kim Hyunjo told me he was coming down with other people.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, it was as I expected.</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon. And Im Jowon and Chief Sung.</p><br/><p>I saw familiar faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, why are they suddenly\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Stuttering, the flustered Seo Eunkyo glared at me.</p><br/><p>Since it looked like she was asking if I purposely told them to talk here because I knew others would be coming down, I gave her a big smile.</p><br/><p>Of course, I did it on purpose.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Asian tiger Snake \u2013 *cough* happens to also mean gold digger.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-126\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 126\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-128\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 128\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201367\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

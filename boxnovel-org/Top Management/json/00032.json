When Pure Star started to talk, married women weren\u2019t anything special, he really had all sorts of different fetishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I was going crazy\u2026</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>So Sung Dowon lied? It was a lie that he attended a party like that for the first time out of curiosity. He had just been lucky to not have his photo taken, his claims that he felt dejected and that he never touched that married woman may also have been lies.</p><br/><p>Wow\u2026 The back of my head tingled.</p><br/><p>Why did I worry about him?</p><br/><p>If this kept happening, then I might lose my trust in humanity or turn cynical. My soul had just taken a blow.</p><br/><p>Still, how fortunate was I that I took a long time to decide because I kept recalling Neptune. If I accepted his offer to be his manager right away, I might have difficulty breathing right about now.</p><br/><p>Did I have to consider this bad or good luck?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what happened to Sung Dowon afterwards? It didn\u2019t seem like he moved to China either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did work on a few projects in China, but they didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019m not too sure myself. Since there were grounds to blame Sung Dowon, W&amp;U had already terminated the contract before the whole thing blew up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa. No one ever thought\u2026 Sung Dowon would end up like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it Dowon or Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader asked right in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to stay where I am now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t hesitate as I answered and lowered my head.</p><br/><p>When I looked in front of me, the team 2 leader\u2019s eyes had widened as if unable to believe what he had just heard. Everyone was looking at me with surprised expressions.</p><br/><p>In fact, even CEO Baek Hansung revealed a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Luc\u2026 No, Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader came up close and said in a worried voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Carefully think about it again. I think you might have made a poor choice because this is your first time making such an important decision out in society and because it all happened so suddenly. What\u2019s at risk is too large to decide with loyalty and affection.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director added in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Opportunities like this don\u2019t come often. It\u2019s no use if you regret it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this really was an opportunity that is.</p><br/><p>When I was about to reply with a decent refusal.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m dumbfounded. Dowon asked you personally and you kick him away? You can\u2019t even eat when we spoon-feed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When you\u2019re giving me something inedible, do you think I\u2019ll open my mouth happily?</p><br/><p>I slowly calmed by breath and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile I do know this is a big opportunity, but maybe it\u2019s because Neptune is the first group I\u2019ve been assigned to, I keep thinking of them. They are only now starting to take a step forward\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t feel good if I quit now. I am sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I did my best to properly tell them my intentions with the appropriate etiquette.</p><br/><p>When I looked back up with my eyes lowered, Sung Dowon was looking at me a strange look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you really decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I am sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I wanted to work with you. How regretful.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was regretful as well.</p><br/><p>I thought that Sung Dowon had the potential to make it in Hollywood. For his outstanding acting skills to be buried by his dirty scandals\u2026 I was sad for his talent that had met a bad owner.</p><br/><p>Sung Dowon didn\u2019t say anything else. Since he fell back, no one else suggested me to think about it again. Only the team 3 leader asked me twice more if I was certain. The team 2 leader didn\u2019t even bother to look at me.</p><br/><p>I folded my thoughts on asking about Lee Songha\u2019s acting teacher. Although my senses weren\u2019t incredibly quick, it certainly wasn\u2019t good to bring it up now. It would be better to discuss it with Kim Hyunjo first.</p><br/><p>The awkward moment hung in the air momentarily before I was asked to leave. I got up from my seat.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader whispered to me with a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou worked hard today. First go home and rest. We can talk about this again later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Then, I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>I bowed and left the office.</p><br/><p>I closed the door and leaned against it, letting out the sigh I had held back for a while.</p><br/><p>Today was very eventful. I used my head too much that I was exhausted.</p><br/><p>Well, this was how I blew away my chance at becoming the manager of a top star. The notion of becoming a manager of a top star had comforted me when things were tough, but this was how it ended.</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t regret my decision, I still felt a bit dejected.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you crazy bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said right in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a real crazy bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know why, but I laughed. Was I really crazy?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you laugh in a situation like this? What were you thinking when you blew Sung Dowon off\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo halted his agitated voice and glanced next to him. Sung Dowon\u2019s manager, Jang Seomoon, was standing there. Kim Hyunjo clicked his tongue and grabbed my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I followed behind him with swift steps and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I have something to say as well. About Songha\u2019s personal acting teacher, Teacher Shim Kyungtaek. It seems Songha heard bad things from her teacher, I think he might be up to something strange\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the strange one right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is a really important problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd is your problem not important? Do you even know what you kicked away just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>We were talking in front of the elevator when we heard a voice behind us.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked around, Jang Seomoon was walking towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould we\u2026 talk for a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201dI nodded my head. The elevator doors opened.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo sighed and got on the elevator by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the basement practice room; so come there once you\u2019re done. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Seomoon and I went out into the emergency stairwell.</p><br/><p>Underneath the dim yellow light, Jang Seomoon was hesitant for a while.</p><br/><p>I had met this person exactly three times before. All three times weren\u2019t exactly under good circumstances. First was when he came into the washroom with Sung Dowon, he didn\u2019t look at me friendlily. He had turned pale the second time. And I had almost taken this person\u2019s spot not too long ago, so there was no way the mood could be good.</p><br/><p>My mind was complicated.</p><br/><p>Jang Seomoon sighed before saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you refuse? Being Dowon hyung\u2019s manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, because of Neptune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that\u2026 but is that true? I honestly can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was mainly because of Neptune, but I also have my own reasons for refusing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Seomoon wet his lips and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough it probably isn\u2019t the case, but\u2026 if you were worried I\u2019d harass you if you accepted, I wanted to tell you that you don\u2019t have to be worried. Since it is a good opportunity for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd even if I don\u2019t get fired, I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I could, I wanted to tell him.</p><br/><p>That this situation was a blessing in disguise. Although he currently felt like the world was collapsing because he would have to quit being Sung Dowon\u2019s manager, in the near future, he would think he was lucky to be fired now.</p><br/><p>Jang Seomoon roughly tangled his back hair and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I be fired so suddenly after all I did\u2026 Haa, fuck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I think Sung Dowon was more at fault\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Seomoon stopped momentarily before smiling slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw my team leader\u2026 no, the team 2 leader inside, right? The bearded guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be because he has never been a manager before, but if something good happens, it\u2019s because of the celebrity, and anything bad is because of the manager. He holds grudges so it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t meet him for a while. He probably never thought that you would refuse that offer so his pride must have taken a blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>His last words had a hint of joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was already thinking about doing just that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded at my reply and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 What you said just now. About Teacher Shim Kyungtaek. That someone who took his lessons was criticized severely by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do have something, it\u2019s not certain, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Since he was someone who had been assigned to an actor until now, he might know something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Please tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard this when I had drinks with Chief Jo a long time ago. You know that Son Chaeyoung\u2019s very emotional, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew it well.</p><br/><p>But why did Son Chaeyoung suddenly come up again?</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jo said that he felt tired to death trying to soothe her since she felt wary and insecure whenever she saw new actors with potential. There are a quite of few actors like her. Since, as long as she does well, her company will promote and treat her better. She doesn\u2019t want to share.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung and that acting teacher are close.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, Kim Hyunjo said it as well. That the teacher taught Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung really follows him around, calling him, \u2018Teacher, teacher\u2019. Well\u2026 This is all simply my own speculation from what I\u2019ve heard from others, and I don\u2019t know if there really is something up with them so just take that into account.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because nothing was certain, I would have to check, but it did sound a bit suspicious.</p><br/><p>I would have to talk to Kim Hyunjo and learn more about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen take care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I hope Neptune does well in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>We said our farewells, and Jang Seomoon disappeared down the stairs while I took the elevator. I went up to the 4<sup>th</sup> floor to get my bag, and when I was waiting for the elevator, my phone vibrated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Mr. Manager. I am Park Woojeong. Is it okay to talk?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I saw the article you published.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear her voice that didn\u2019t know what to do because she was so happy from the other side of the call.</p><br/><p>-That was my first exclusive article.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s all thanks to you. Food and drinks will be on me. When are you free?</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought for a moment before licking my lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have a proper schedule to schedule anything ahead of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t even met with my friends after getting hired.</p><br/><p>-Haha, to be honest, it\u2019s the same for me. Even during breaks, I have to be nervous and wait. If something pops up, I have to cancel all my plans and run over, so it\u2019s a bit hard to set any personal schedules.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, break. I suddenly recalled what day today was.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Now that I think about it, today was my break.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Pardon? But what are you doing now? There isn\u2019t much time left.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>We diverted our sympathy for each other with laughter. Hahaha.</p><br/><p>When I hung up after agreeing to set a date when we had time, the elevator arrived at the basement.</p><br/><p>Knock, knock.</p><br/><p>After knocking on the door, I went in and stopped. All four girls of Neptune and Kim Hyunjo. The five of them were looking at me with the same expression.</p><br/><p>Expressions wondering if I was in my right mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa! Did you really kick away Sung Dowon and come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung ran over to me and asked while grabbing both my arms.</p><br/><p>Next to her, Kim Hyunjo clicked his tongue and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe girls won\u2019t believe me. Do you understand what sort of unbelievable thing you did?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I nodded my head, Im Seoyoung fell back hesitantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You really kicked away a top star and came here? After kicking a national star?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 Things ended up that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThi-things ended up that way? What the heck! You\u2019re crazy! Crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only Im Seoyoung, but the other girls were surprised and talking amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. He\u2019s crazy. It was already strange he came to work during his break.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo gestured towards me and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was able to sneak a peek, and that Sung Dowon, that top star, requested that he\u2019d like him to be his manager with his head lowered. But then, this guy\u2019s like, \u2018I keep thinking of Neptune,\u2019 then didn\u2019t even look back and left!\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-31\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 31\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-33\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 33\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201176\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

I thought that we would go directly to the CEO\u2019s office, but the elevator stopped on the fourth floor. And people poured in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater! Someone get me some ice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDokyung, get it together!\u201d</p><br/><p>That moment, I wondered if I was in an ambulance instead of an elevator. Two managers held both arms of a woman who had collapsed like a corpse. They were pretty much dragging her in. Her disheveled, curly, red hair shook.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of the bottle! Get it together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be able to get it together once I drink some!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Dokyung shouted while holding the neck of a bottle. It was vodka.</p><br/><p>They definitely looked fine at the airport.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only Lee Dokyung. The other actors were wrecks as well. Yoon Sangah was wailing while tears and snot ran down her face. Jang Yohan was puffing smoke with a pale face. Managers and staff were doing their best to comfort them.</p><br/><p>It was a mess. If someone saw this, they would this they were at a rehab center than an entertainment agency.</p><br/><p>Lee Dokyung, who finally lost her bottle of vodka, flailed about.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it back! Give it back!\u201d</p><br/><p>She fell on the floor and ended up just lying on it. She wasn\u2019t an actress. She was completely wasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man in his early forties wearing a suit with no tie pushed others out the way as he approached.</p><br/><p>He was the Team 1 Leader, whom I had greeted only on occasion. He received the bottle of vodka from a manager and downed it instantly. Then he filled with ice water an employee brought over and handed it to Lee Dokyung.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere. Now bring them up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Dokyung was dragged off by the managers.</p><br/><p>Soon, the Team 1 Leader snatched the cigarettes from Jang Yohan\u2019s lips and gestured with his chin. Another manager took Jang Yohan away. The only one left was Yoon Sangah. He approached the now sobbing Yoon Sangah. Taking a drag, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cStop crying. It\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t expect the press\u2019s reactions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, I-I can\u2019t breathe. Let me go to the washroom and calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Sangah was brought downstairs by her manager. The lounge finally became quiet. Belatedly coming to their senses, employee rushed to greet the Team 1 Leader. He nodded while walking towards me. No, not to me, but the trashcan behind me.</p><br/><p>After throwing the cigarette butt in the trash, he said to the Team 3 Leader,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been fine here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader evasively replied. The Team 1 Leader suddenly smiled before turning to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about your news of your success, but I couldn\u2019t congratulate you. Shall we have drinks some time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding, the Team 1 Leader went upstairs.</p><br/><p>The lounge was chaotic after the storm had passed. Everyone was busy trying to predict what was going on in the CEO\u2019s office. I went up to the fifth floor. The PR Team was on the battlefield. Team Leader Park and her employees were shouting into their phones.</p><br/><p>I went into my office and turned on my computer. The actors\u2019 names were all over the real-time search rankings. Especially Lee Dokyung. She was an actor who stood at the peak in the country before going to the US, so people\u2019s reactions were more heated.</p><br/><p>It looked like it\u2019ll be noisy for the next few days.</p><br/><p>While I was reading articles, my door suddenly burst open. This time, it was Chief Lee Bongjoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, I think you should go downstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Team 1 go down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the actors. But Lee Dokyung, right now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid she flop on the floor again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she got in a fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 What the heck was this all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>She should be busy with drama shoots these days.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are downstairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Dokyung and her don\u2019t get along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anyone Son Chaeyoung gets along with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike very bad. Lee Dokyung flaunted a ton about how she was going to Hollywood.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to imagine Lee Dokyung, who caused a fuss while holding a bottle of vodka, and Son Chaeyoung together.</p><br/><p>Then I gave up. It lowered my blood sugar.</p><br/><p>When I went back down, there really was an incredible mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off! Did you come to mock me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I came to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said while munching on donuts instead of popcorn. Her face was overflowing with vigor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was about to explode because of how tight the shooting schedule was, but seeing your face washed all my stress away. Do you even remember the last time you had a tight schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I heard your drama flopped too! So you lost your commercials too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I keep getting projects. Ah, do you want a minor role in my drama?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy bitch, you keep-!\u201d</p><br/><p>The managers tried to hold Lee Dokyung back as she tried to rush at Son Chaeyoung while wielding the vodka bottle. It was far from enough. The other employees retreated back like there was a contagious disease.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon poked my side.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you stop Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are close enough to exchange donuts.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was a deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe acting Team 2 Leader will probably stop her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said, looking in the direction of the vending machines. Chief Jo Byunghwan, who was the acting team leader in place of the Team 2 Leader, was shouting at someone. Ah, it was Chief Lee Janghyun. He at least looked human when he went around looking for ripe persimmons, but now he was about to croak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe company\u2019s already in turmoil. How could you bring Son Chaeyoung here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe went straight here after seeing the news on TV. How could I have stopped her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Stopping her is your job, bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen fire me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo Byunghwan yelled while pointing at him.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon, who was watching, clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat team is becoming crazier every passing day. But Lee Janghyun, wasn\u2019t he lingering around, wanting to manage Songha? He\u2019s been quiet recently. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the type to give up easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cah, I made a promise, so I let him fill in for me once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that Son Chaeyoung was better than Songha and left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon\u2019s expression turned odd. His lips opened as if to say something, but a grim voice sounded out from the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so noisy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 1 Leader came down from the stair landing. The murmuring employees shut their mouths. Son Chaeyoung and Lee Dokyung stopped what they were doing and looked over at him. The Team 1 Leader looked around the lounge as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sangah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief No, who followed her, isn\u2019t picking up. We sent a road manager to look for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Team 1 employee, who I wasn\u2019t familiar with, replied. At the same time, someone added while stuttering,</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Yoon-Yoon Sangah\u2019s over there though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d</p><br/><p>His finger pointed to the TV. Everyone\u2019s gazes gathered there. The flat screen still played the entertainment gossip program. And Yoon Sangah was among them.</p><br/><p>Surrounded by reporters and holding onto an interview mic.</p><br/><p>-Then you\u2019re saying that your agency pressured you into going to the US?</p><br/><p>-Yes, I personally thought it was too early to go to Hollywood, but the CEO and team leader were quite persistent. I couldn\u2019t refuse their proposal. I only did what they told me to do for the past few years in the US.</p><br/><p>Oh my god.</p><br/><p>The scuffle between Son Chaeyoung and Lee Dokyung wasn\u2019t the problem.</p><br/><p>Yoon Sangah was dropping bombs on live TV.</p><br/><p>-And when you mentioned you were forced to act in a nude scene\u2026</p><br/><p>-I received a casting offer for a new US cable channel TV show, and the role only had nude and sex scenes. I told them that I couldn\u2019t do it multiple times, but they said I had to if I wanted to raise my popularity\u2026</p><br/><p>Miserable tears poured from Yoon Sangah\u2019s eyes. The camera zoomed in on her wet eyes.</p><br/><p>-Then you must have a grudge on your agency.</p><br/><p>-Yes, it\u2019s because of them, that my life as an actor is ruined.</p><br/><p>Yoon Sangah wailed again. Her cries echoed throughout the lounge. Everyone simply looked at the TV with dumbstruck expressions. The PR Team on the fifth floor screamed indecipherable swears.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I guess she still thinks she\u2019s in Hollywood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 1 Leader said from behind. He frowned as he waved his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cContact the legal team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 1 employee quickly acted after receiving his orders.</p><br/><p>The Team 1 Leader disappeared into his office, and the employees, finally coming to their senses, caused an uproar.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon blankly mumbled,</p><br/><p>I guess we won\u2019t be able to hold a get-together today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I guess so.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The legal and PR team acted quickly to settle the matter. They sent out articles explaining the situation. This wasn\u2019t an incident we wanted to drag on since Yoon Sangah\u2019s interview was quite far from the truth.</p><br/><p>The W&amp;U denouncing public quickly turned their gaze at Yoon Sangah.</p><br/><p>However, separate from the truth, W&amp;U and Yoon Sangah continued to be mentioned in articles and by the public. W&amp;U received a strong blow to their image after failing to enter the US market, while Yoon Sangah became known to have been afflicted with \u2018Hollywood\u2019 disease.</p><br/><p>If Yoon Sangah wanted to gain popularity through incidents like in Hollywood gossip girls, then she definitely succeeded.</p><br/><p>Well, unlike Hollywood, one couldn\u2019t live off gossip.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung and the Team 1 Leader wouldn\u2019t stop with just an explanation.</p><br/><p>Anyways, while the company was busying putting out fires, things were progress quickly on my side. We continued auditioning for City Jungle, and my spot amongst judges constantly became newsworthy.</p><br/><p>These were crazy days for various reasons.</p><br/><p>However, there was a day where my idle thoughts were completely washed away.</p><br/><p>Reading.</p><br/><p>Whenever I saw Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon act in the basement, I became absorbed by it like I was on drugs. It was to the point where I forgot whether they were practicing or if it was real. Scenes that made me tense as I read them swallowed me whole when I watched them.</p><br/><p>I finally took a deep breath after seeing the last scene.</p><br/><p>It was already well into the night when I checked the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop here for today.\u201d</p><br/><p>I handed the two of them water and towels. Lee Songha ignored my hand and stood up. Her shoulders and back moved flexibly like an animal\u2019s beneath her sweat-soaked t-shirt. This was the result of the fitness trainer and martial artist director.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wash my face to recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said in a monotone voice before leaving the practice room.</p><br/><p>This was something we experienced every time. It took a while before Lee Songha returned to her normal self after completely immersing herself in her role. She was like this for every project she worked on, but it seemed to take a particularly long time with City Jungle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said while catching his breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI could match her back during Alive, but I can\u2019t keep up with her this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bringing his head back, he covered his face with a towel. His shoulders and chest heaved.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because he was on a strict diet to make the paper-weak figure of an artist, but his already impoverished and faint appearance grew even fainter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that I will be too behind. I need to at least act the part of the lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said with a quiet laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still wonder why you picked me. Especially when I\u2019m reading with Songha. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to act like her even if my life depended on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI received some sort of revelation that Songha must act.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I saw the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I was shocked for different reasons when I met you. You were totally my type.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon laughed at the joke at the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026 you hold a special meaning to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I mumbled before changing the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw a ton of actors while holding auditions, and there really were a lot of people who were great at acting. However, I didn\u2019t receive any revelation, like with Songha, nor was as shocked as when I saw you. I guess my preferences are high class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, your preferences are what? What\u2019s high class?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha came back with water still dripping. She had come with hurried steps.</p><br/><p>Her immersed role was completely gone, and she was Lee Songha from head to toe.</p><br/><p>Soon, laughs warmed the practice room.</p><br/><p>Fall was really short.</p><br/><p>Winter was even shorter. Spring seriously passed in a breeze.</p><br/><p>At some point, we were finally approaching summer again.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-210\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 210\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-212\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 212\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201521\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

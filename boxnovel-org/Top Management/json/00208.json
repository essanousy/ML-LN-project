There\u2019s a limit to the amount of money you can gather through crowdfunding. It\u2019s also used a lot for charity or sponsorships than investments. It may be useful for an independent or a low budget film, but it probably won\u2019t be of much use for our film.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of blockbusters do it these days though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more for marketing than investments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, for marketing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their expressions became strange.</p><br/><p>I laid out the plain I had organized in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe set a small target amount for funding. Although we say that it\u2019s investing in the film, it\u2019s simply giving the public an interesting event to participate in. We increased the public\u2019s interest in Pretty Girls\u2019 album with the production of Making Film, and it was received quite well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018quite\u2019. It was great.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer said in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will also increase the public\u2019s interest. There are tons of people who are interested in whether the project I\u2019m set on will be a success or a flop. Whether it\u2019s a thousand or ten thousand won, once the audience\u2019s money comes in as an investment, even more people will be interested in the result. Of course, it\u2019ll help with marketing the film as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019ll probably be incomparably more helpful than an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the general public\u2019s interest surges, there will also be venture capitals that\u2019ll decide to belatedly invest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might even receive too much and be unable to accept any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the public will be more interested the more I take part in the production of the film.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason people used top stars as leads was, in the end, to increase public interest. Unlike drama that air whenever you turn on the TV, films put more burden on the audience as they had to physically go to the theatres to watch it. That was why companies spent billions of won making posters and promoting the movie.</p><br/><p>A power to bring people to the theatres.</p><br/><p>If Nam Joyoon lacked ticket-selling power, then I simply had to make up the difference.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you saying that you\u2019ll participate in full force?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unexpected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but what if\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer hesitated. Well-Made\u2019s general manager picked up after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis film might be a complete flop. If the crowdfunding participants and partial investors cannot get a return on their investments, the image you built up will worsen drastically. It could also destroy your \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 title.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded candidly. The project producer asked with a flustered expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain that we\u2019ll at least breakeven?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m 100% certain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Or to be exact, I personally decided to step on the uncertain path.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why do you want to take on more risk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis film. I want to make it a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a path of uncertainty, but for some reason, I began to be certain.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the lukewarm certainty that it wouldn\u2019t be a complete flop even if it wasn\u2019t as big as a success as the version I saw in my visions.</p><br/><p>The movie City Jungle, in which Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon starred in, directed by Director Oh Hyunkyung, produced by Forest and SBE Film, invested by investors who took a risk in its low possibility of success, and distributed by Well-Made Pictures.</p><br/><p>The certainty that this film would be a success.</p><br/><p>No, I began to become certain that I can make this film into a success.</p><br/><p>The project producer and Well-Made\u2019s general manager\u2019s eyes darted back and forth. They seemed to be calculating how to use me, the promotional item, as effectively as possible. Their pens quickly scribbled on their notebooks.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, I brought up another condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, if things progress like this, I need to receive something in return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, if there\u2019s something you want, then please say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well-Made\u2019s general manager said with a face of a salesman.</p><br/><p>I leisurely said,</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, regarding the actors\u2019 contract fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fee. That makes me nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well-Made\u2019s general manager laughed jokingly. As he said, his face became tense. Was he worried I would ask for an absurd amount? Of course, I wasn\u2019t planning on taking out a huge chunk of our insufficient production budget. Only\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope we could sign with running guarantee than a full contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA running guarantee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, in a way where they get additional money when after the film breaks even.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was similar to how investors split their shares. It would be a useless contract if the film didn\u2019t break even, but they would gradually accumulate money once the film broke even and began making profits.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think our side will be more motivated.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Well-Made\u2019s general manager and project producer exchanged looks before nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a hard condition. Let\u2019s go with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of my lips rose as I continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd another\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>{\u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 Jung Sunwoo, who has had no failures, his next project City Jungle, what kind of film is it?}</p><br/><p>{W&amp;Y\u2019s \u2018Jung Sunwoo\u2019s Team\u2019 Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon confirmed for film City Jungle.}</p><br/><p>{Director Oh Hyunkyung, the director Midas\u2019s Hand teamed up with for City Jungle, will she able to break the prejudice against \u2018Unknown\u2019 and \u2018Female\u2019 Directors?}</p><br/><p>The bait we sent as a press release instantly spread like wildfire. Because Pretty Girls and Neptune\u2019s new songs were still at the top of the charts and were appearing on TV and stages, nothing else had to be done for City Jungle and my name to hit the real-time search rankings.</p><br/><p>We sent out short details about City Jungle and crowdfunding.</p><br/><p>We set the period for crowdfunding after the film has been shot. That was when we need to put our efforts into promoting the film. The small funding target will be reached quickly, so if we started it too early, people might have already forgotten about the crowdfunding event by the time the movie releases.</p><br/><p>As expected, the public\u2019s interests were peaked.</p><br/><p>-Oh, my god. A director I\u2019ve never heard of and Nam Joyoon as the lead? This is a real gamble.</p><br/><p>-According to someone from Chungmuro, that scenario has been rolling around with any investments.</p><br/><p>-Trash journalists predicted that Jung Sunwoo\u2019s next project would be a safe blockbuster, but Jung Sunwoo\u2019s completely doing things his way LOL \u2018Move, I\u2019m going down my own path\u2019/</p><br/><p>-How will this funding work? Maybe I should put all the money I spend on the lottery and put it in there.</p><br/><p>-You should only invest a small amount and consider it gone when investing in films. Return rates are a mess.</p><br/><p>-A guy I know\u2019s a director, and apparently, there are bad rumors about Jung Sunwoo these days. They\u2019re out of money.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just online. People I met were all eager to talk about it.</p><br/><p>I received as many questions as lead actors at a VIP Film Festival I was invited to.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung, is City Jungle\u2019s scenario really that good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we send some of our rookies for supporting role auditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait. Did you also invest your own money into the film?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The majority seemed interested and supported the film, but there also many who whispered about how it was a foolish decision. That I would have been better off picking a relatively safer project.</p><br/><p>Ah, there were also people who mocked me in my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I was wondering which great director you would work with after rejecting me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho, who I encountered in front of the washroom, snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Oh Hyunkyung? Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the director of City Jungle of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are differences between directors. Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, you really work foolishly. I heard you\u2019ve developed a panic disorder while picking your next project. The female lead role you rejected, we cast Han Seoyeon instead. I think she\u2019s much better than Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>This fellow was making blunt remarks.</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho smirked as he patted my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should come watch my film when it releases. I\u2019ll send you a screening ticket. You need to see what you missed so that you don\u2019t make the same mistake again. Ah, if the film flops after all this media hubbub, there might be no next time. CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s cold-hearted.\u201d</p><br/><p>While leisurely walking past me, he added,</p><br/><p>\u201cCity Jungle or whatever. I\u2019ll pay my own money and watch it. That\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho looked back at me.</p><br/><p>I spoke with a gentle voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only saying this since you keep saying I missed out on your project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI rejected that film because I thought it would flop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSupernatural. I rejected it because I thought it would flop. Won\u2019t you need around 4 million viewers to break even? I think it\u2019ll be a complete failure. There is no need to send my actress to a failing film so that she can fail together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you, just what\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho\u2019s eyes bulged like a fish.</p><br/><p>Seeing him stutter with a stiff tongue, I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so serious when I\u2019m just guy with poor judgment?\u201d</p><br/><p>I brushed off his hand, which was still on my shoulder, and walked away.</p><br/><p>After a long while, I heard him burst into swears behind me.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After the heat wave passed, and a cool breeze now blew on mornings and evenings.</p><br/><p>With Well-Made\u2019s investments and investments from partial investors we\u2019ve scraped together, we finally began preparing to film. The film schedule and content meetings progressed day and night, and we filled our staff with SBE Film\u2019s leadership.</p><br/><p>At the same time, we were looking to cast supporting and minor roles.</p><br/><p>\u201cActor casting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we were hoping you would participate in auditions and the casting process.\u201d</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s project producer handed me a thick file. Opening it, it was full of actor profiles. There were some familiar faces, but the majority were new to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe discussed what would be something you can participate in and be a hot topic when released in articles, and we concluded that it would be most interesting if you participated in casting actors. Your eye for actors is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer added two more similarly thick files as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are all the ones we received at our company so far, so take a look at their pictures. We made an announcement, so we\u2019ll have to hold auditions soon. We are trying to approach actors with enough popularity to play supporting roles, but it might not work out since Mr. Nam Joyoon is the lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah, that could happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>They might not be satisfied with a lead with less fame than them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult to fill all our minor roles through just auditions. Auditions are also differentiated between big budgets and smaller budgets. Good actors aim for auditions for blockbusters that are likely to be a success or films of well-known directors to get close to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet Alive had it easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we were overflowing with applicants. I wonder when we\u2019ll ever be able to experience that boom again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licking his lips, the project producer led me to the office. Perhaps it was because they were working throughout the night finishing up preparations before the filming began, but SBE Film and Forest\u2019s employees were flopped over chairs and desks and sleeping.</p><br/><p>Someone with their arms crossed was standing beside a sofa messily stacked with files.</p><br/><p>His clothes were so tidy that it was borderline mysophobia. He was a man in his thirties, who looked like he would smell like ink if you got close. After seeing us, he uncrossed his arms and came over. His eyes were filled with interest as they looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung, which is Chief Lee Kyojin. He\u2019s the casting director.\u201d</p><br/><p>Casting director?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung was staring out the window.</p><br/><p>The director, who was sitting on the sofa, glanced at him while asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you planning on doing about Jung Sunwoo, Team Leader Jung, if City Jungle fails?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reply. The director scratched his round chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve been quiet on the matter, everyone\u2019s been making their own predictions. There are also rumors that you\u2019re going to fire him.\u201d</p><br/><p>There still was no answer.</p><br/><p>Swirling his tea with a teaspoon, the director raised his head before flinching.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung was silently laughing.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-207\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 207\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-209\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 209\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201518\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

There will be no contract issues if the girls sign with any other company. You do not have to worry about that. A member who actually left before\u2026 already signed with another company and is preparing for a debut.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have a company, and their group was about to disband.</p><br/><p>I said to Chief Lee Taeshin, who had a pitiful expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cOur company has no plans on selecting new trainees at the moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He bit his lips. His busted lip grew redder.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they want to join another company, they\u2019ll have to be separated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoping that they end up in the same company is just wishful thinking on my part. If a decent company is willing to accept them, then even if they have to separate\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the sniffling members cried out. Her cries quickly infected the others. They faltered like they were drunk from all that crying. Chief Lee Taeshin looked at them with a heartbroken expression.</p><br/><p>A member grabbed his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will happen to you if we go? You borrowed a lot of money for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if loan sharks come and take your \u2018sinjang\u2019 and \u2018kongpat\u2019<sup>{1}</sup>?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin rubbed his red eyes. Then he nonchalantly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou worry too much. I didn\u2019t borrow from people like them. Also, \u2018sinjang\u2019 and \u2018kongpat\u2019 are the same thing. I\u2019ll die if I sell them both. Study hard so you don\u2019t embarrass yourself when you go on entertainment shows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the problem right now? Is it?! Chief\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust worry about yourselves. You can just call me back once you\u2019re successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>I watched from a distance as they held each other and wailed like a family separating. My cool head filled itself with calculations.</p><br/><p>My decision became even more resolute.</p><br/><p>I will bring them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about releasing your single album? As planned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin turned to look at me.</p><br/><p>Confusion spread on his despairing face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn album?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their wails stopped instantly.</p><br/><p>We cleaned up the messy floor and sat in a circle.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin and the girls seemed dazed. Since I brought up releasing an album together, they were busy trying to figure out what I meant and exchanging glances with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, could I listen to the song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-the song?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one you received from the songwriter DOM. Do you have other songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no. We only have that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that that song has been handed over to someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! Yeondu, the laptop\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>A member hastily got up. Soon, a laptop was placed on the floor. Chief Lee Taeshin searched for the audio file. His hand seemed stiff as the cursor moved in strange directions. A song began to play soon.</p><br/><p>It was the \u2018guide\u2019 version. Someone was humming over the instrumentals.</p><br/><p>While listening to the song, Chief Lee Taeshin and the girls waited with bated breaths.</p><br/><p>The not-even-four-minute song quickly ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 How is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin asked with an anxious expression.</p><br/><p>I looked at him and the three goldfish and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s good? It\u2019s catchy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRe-really?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was a lie.</p><br/><p>I licked my lips and lied. To be honest, I had no idea. This song brought an unknown group to the top of the charts. It wasn\u2019t short-lived since this lasted at least two weeks.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said the song would be a hit no matter who sang it so I thought I could tell as soon as I heard it.</p><br/><p>I understood that it was nice to listen to. However, that was it. At least for me.</p><br/><p>Well, this was comparable to when I first heard Lee Taehee\u2019s song, Satellite, as well.</p><br/><p>I become confident with this. My ears were crap.</p><br/><p>Still, what was fortunate was that I felt the same way when I heard the songs Lee Taehee played for me not too long ago. Should I say it felt like the possibility that they were all good enough to shoot for first place was steadily increasing?</p><br/><p>As expected, I should play them for my other team members and the A&amp;R team and discuss with them. I\u2019m curious which one Kim Hyunjo would like the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, about releasing an album with us, were you serious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hesitant voice trailed off.</p><br/><p>The other members pulled the member who said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, how could you disturb him?! He\u2019s thinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I was just so curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEndure it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The goldfish whispered to each other while examining my expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes bulged even more when they heard me. Their mouths opened and closed.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin looked at me. He looked all choked up.</p><br/><p>I stretched out my hand towards him and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince an album isn\u2019t done on one\u2019s own, I\u2019ll have to discuss with my company to know for sure, but I\u2019m serious. I hope that we can work on Pretty Girls\u2019 next single together. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>He held my hand without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin shook his leg anxiously.</p><br/><p>He was attempting to contact the members who left the group.</p><br/><p>Jung Jae\u2019s phone had been turned off since her call with me. When I told him what had happened, Chief Lee Taeshin pitifully said that there were some circumstances and that he would talk with her once he got a hold of her.</p><br/><p>However, Jung Jae wasn\u2019t the only one who wasn\u2019t responding.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the remaining two members. When calling, one rang while the other hung up mid-ring.</p><br/><p>They seemed to be avoiding answering their calls.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe girls are too hot-headed right now\u2026 You girls try and call them too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t answer your phone, they probably won\u2019t answer ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The goldfish mumbled as they called. There was no answer.</p><br/><p>Instead, one of them received a text.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin quickly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it? Is it one of the girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hyojin unni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyojin? What did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 To stop calling her because it\u2019s pissing her off. She also told me to tell you not to call her anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed upset by the text as her swollen cheeks trembled.</p><br/><p>I heard that they left on a bad note, but it seemed the situation was worse than I initially thought. Now that I thought about it, Chief Lee Taeshin did mention the \u2018unnis\u2019 psychological warfare\u2019. Were they not close?</p><br/><p>\u201cWould it be okay if I mentioned you in the text?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin asked desperately.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe girls will definitely change their minds if they learn that you\u2019ll be helping out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit tricky\u2026 It could be leaked to the press if someone else reads it. The reporters are waiting for any bit of news, so things will get complicated if this leaks to the press before things are certain. Also, the members\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I also had my doubts.</p><br/><p>Even if the girls returned after Chief Lee Taeshin mentions my name, would they be able to group together as Pretty Girls once again? When the glass has already shattered?</p><br/><p>They would have been successful together if it wasn\u2019t for the butterfly effect I created. I would feel less guilty if I got them back on track, but so long as I decided to bring them together, I had to consider the possible risks as well.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t like I personally talked with the members prior so my concerns were unfounded for now.</p><br/><p>I shook my head and got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I think I\u2019ll need to head to work. Let\u2019s meet up once we settle our problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>The members saw me out. Chief Lee Taeshin told the girls to stay inside and followed me out to the parking lot alone. He hesitated before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t bring it up because of the girls, but would W&amp;U invest in a group like us? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s an insignificant investment. If you give me a day, I think I\u2019ll be able to procure some more money. Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I got in my minivan and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease let me handle that.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader looked around the office before calling Kim Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>He bought two coffees from the vending machine as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Lucky Charm not coming to work today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019ll come after doing something first. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Drinking the warm coffee, the Team 3 Leader got to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looked like he had a lot of worries yesterday, don\u2019t you need to talk with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already did?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep forgetting because I\u2019m an incompetent sunbae who he\u2019s already surpassed, but I\u2019m his superior. We had a good talk last night that you aren\u2019t aware of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said jokingly. The Team 3 Leader patted his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the talk ended well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so? Let\u2019s see his expression when he comes into work\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo paused. Jung Sunwoo got off the elevator.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo\u2019s eyes widened when he discovered the two in front of the vending machine. The corners of his lips curled up. Seeing him approach them with steadfast steps, the Team 3 Leader poked Kim Hyunjo\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re gifted in counseling others? His face is lively today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? Maybe I should change careers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, chief, I have something I want to discuss with you. Are you free right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo suddenly asked. The two nodded with dazed faces.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the three sat facing each other in a meeting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? What do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you happen to know the girl group, Pretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty Girls? I think I\u2019ve heard of them before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they the rookies with multiple flops? What about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo tilted their head as they had no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are preparing for a digital single for their next album, but there was a problem and they no longer have a company. Their preparations are about to go belly up as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s common. They\u2019ll soon disband I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what about these Pretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he waited for this, Jung Sunwoo said in a clear voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to take care of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The clip of Pretty Girls\u2019 performance ended.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo stared at the black screen a while longer. Their complexions were similarly dark. Soon, the Team 3 Leader downed his cold coffee. The paper cup crumbled in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly three high schoolers remain out of those six. The others already packed their bags and left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the situation as of right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you want to produce their single album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat song is by some unknown songwriter by the name of Domi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s DOM.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a domi or gajami!\u201d<sup>{2}</sup></p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader shouted before grasping the back of his neck. He groaned.</p><br/><p>He then asked Kim Hyunjo, who was rubbing his face,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what kind of talk did you say you had last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That his life wasn\u2019t over with a single failure. To enjoy work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said that in order to help him deal with the pressure, but I think the dosage was too high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just high, he needs a doping test. He\u2019s not in his right mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader shook his head.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo sighed as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why did you have to get caught up in something strange again? Mr. Nam Joyoon was at least by himself. These girls are a group. Also, it\u2019s not something that can be handled on your own. To make an album, they\u2019ll need a recording, mixing, and choreography team as well. They\u2019ll also need to film the music video. On top of that, they\u2019ll need stylists and makeup artists. That\u2019s a huge investment. The risk is too high if it fails. Doesn\u2019t seem absurd to you as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm, I know you have a good eye. I do, but this is very excessive. There\u2019s no need to even bring this up to the director or CEO. Just go ask any employee outside. I bet they\u2019ll all think you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Quickly venting this, the Team 3 Leader said in a more consoling manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf their potential is a shame to lose, then we can feature them on one of Neptune\u2019s songs. So, don\u2019t think about producing some single album and focus on Neptune\u2019s full album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll benefit Neptune as well if the results are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am confident that the results will be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo looked at them and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I have the plans too.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung entered his office. The director, who was already sitting inside, put down his teacup and stood up. His greeting was full of laughter. The director\u2019s round cheeks wiggled like he was holding himself back from laughing out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm\u2019s actions are getting funnier by the day. He\u2019s my energizer these days. He brought over an actor who was unknown for ten years and raised him to success. Now he\u2019s caught up with a girl group that\u2019s about to disband. One where half the members have left.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director chuckled for a good while.</p><br/><p>He sated his throat with black tea before finally managing to hold back his laughter. He then said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it really is strange. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s Lucky Charm, but I\u2019m anticipating how it\u2019ll go. What will happen once the girl group is in their care? I almost want to let him do it just to see how it pans out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director said joyfully before suddenly frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my. I need to keep my tongue in check. The reporters will go crazy if they hear about this. They\u2019ll be in a frenzy, I bet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we hear it? What his thoughts are?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director immediately pulled out his phone and called someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the CEO just arrived. Tell Lucky Charm to come up.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> \u2018Sinjang\u2019 and \u2018kongpat\u2019 both mean kidneys</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> \u2018Domi\u2019 and \u2018Gajami\u2019 are types of fish</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-149\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 149\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-151\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 151\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201412\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

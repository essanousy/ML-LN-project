Maybe it isn\u2019t this team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said it is Team 4. Maybe he\u2019s inside the team leader\u2019s office?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s there. The door was closed all lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Youths who looked to be in middle school or high school were gathered behind the stairs as they whispered to each other. They all had pretty faces, likely having heard compliments that they should be celebrities.</p><br/><p>With their consecutive success with Blackout and Neptune, the strategic planning team and the Management Team 3 decided to create a more robust in-house system and were holding auditions. These youths were trainees who made the final cut.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you\u2019re guaranteed to succeed if that team leader says so. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the same thing. Compliments! He has to compliment you. Song Inho oppa said in an interview that he blew up after the team leader told him he thought he\u2019d do well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I saw him just once in the elevator, but I couldn\u2019t say hi because I was so scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The trainees became flustered at the sudden question. Seeing the slender woman with her arms crossed, the trainees whispered, \u201cPR Team Leader\u201d to each other. Then they greeted her with loud voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you looking for here? Team 3 is downstairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 We still aren\u2019t too familiar with the building.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young man wearing his school uniform, who seemed to be the oldest in the group, took the lead to make an excuse. The other trainees nodded quickly. Seeing this, Team Leader Park quietly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you came to see celebrities? Actors? They don\u2019t usually come here though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? No, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen did you come to see Team Leader Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flinching, the trainees quickly lowered their heads.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park giggled, understanding their reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve waited for nothing. Team Leader Jung\u2019s taking the rare break right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman with short hair like a boy touched the logo on the panel then continued walking. A mean undid his necktie and shoved it in his pocket before following her in a leisurely manner. They were walking up the stairs from W&amp;U\u2019s basement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the competition was fierce since a lot of people applied to Team 4, but I guess we got the prize. To be honest, if it wasn\u2019t for getting into Team 4, I would have seriously considered whether to accept the offer or not. I applied here because of Team Leader Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman glanced at him when he said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you his fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy goal is to become a star manager. He\u2019s a good role model.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman burst out laughing when she saw him say that with a beaming smile.</p><br/><p>On the other side, they heard music and the shouts of a trainer. Saying that it might be Neptune, the man went over only to come back disappointed. They were trainees. Walking around the halls, they encountered other trainees. After walking past the recording and production studios, they finally saw the offices.</p><br/><p>The man spoke in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe company is huge, but there aren\u2019t a lot of people here. Do they have flexible work arrangements?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are probably working away from the office.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see many celebrities either.\u201d</p><br/><p>They looked around the lounge and the outdoor smoking area with a garden before entering the office with the \u2018Team 4\u2019 panel on it. There were more empty chairs than occupied ones. Only a few employees were on their phones or computers working.</p><br/><p>The two of them greeted the employees before looking around the office.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the schedule board, posters of affiliated celebrities\u2019 works, pictures of celebrities holding their film and TV awards, and stacks of Pretty Girls and Neptune\u2019s albums, one would think this was just a normal office.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems this is Team 4\u2019s lineup for the second half of the year?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man murmured as he looked at the ownerless desk. The planner filled for 12 months had fully organized the overwhelming schedule for the second half of the year.</p><br/><p>The day Seo Jijoon\u2019s Korean-Chinese-Japanese joint film would be done filming, the broadcasting schedule of Song Inho\u2019s PBS drama and the release date of his independent film, and the day Im Joowon starts filming. The man examined these schedules before lowering his voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, City Jungle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Placing his finger on the planner, the man\u2019s eyes shined.</p><br/><p>The project had finished filming and was now in the finishing stages of production. It initially became a hot topic due to Jung Sunwoo, Lee Songha, and the crowdfunding announcement. Now, even after half a year had passed, it was still newsworthy.</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of entertainment reporters are chattering about this. Will Midas\u2019s Hand work again or not. Although there are other projects by other actors in Team 4, they only focus on City Jungle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause people are curious about the results.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people who are waiting for it to be released. Additionally, many are talking about how much they are going to invest. Some who are interested in the drama are hoping it completely flops\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The chatting man suddenly straightened his back. Then he bowed like a new recruit. The woman also bowed her head in greeting. Lee Kwanwoo, who they had met once before, was walking into the office. The once known romanticist of W&amp;U, his face looked much more irritated from being overworked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you have a look around? How is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s still a little awkward since it\u2019s my first day to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo\u2019s drooped eyes narrowed at the man\u2019s sociable response.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I went around on set on my first day so I had no opportunity to be awkward. I even remember seeing a thorny path with a devil playing his bugle to welcome me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His calm recollection made the new recruits flinch their shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Team Leader Jung said that he came to work at 3 am and immediately went to Neptune\u2019s music broadcast schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! I read that in an article. He was able to meet Knet\u2019s Producer Go Joontae and get Neptune on Next K-Star that day. While reading the article, my heart raced so much that I wanted to rush on to the scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo made a strange smile before taking the lead. The two new managers quickly followed.</p><br/><p>After they disappeared, the employees, who had seemingly been concentrating on their work, simultaneously raised their heads like meercats.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne month for the guy, and three months for the girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI give that guy a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t think he\u2019ll even last a week? When his heart raced?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether his heart raced or exploded, we need to see how he works. You know the road manager that was recently hired into Team 2? He seemed pretty good, but he sent a message saying that he was quitting after two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat team\u2019s a bit rougher than ours. Compared to them, our team is quite harmonious. The celebrities we are managing are easily to manage for their level in general. Also, working with Team Leader Jung is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The office became quiet.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>My phone vibrated. After checking the contents, I placed my phone back in my pocket.</p><br/><p>It must have rained last night as the wind was moist. I filled a worn bowl with feed and opened the lock to the chicken coop. The chicken coop my father and brother made over the weekend did seem quite legit.</p><br/><p>As soon as I stepped in, the chickens caused a ruckus. I remember my father started raising three or four chicks, but they reproduced so fast that there were around twenty large chickens. I did hear that my father would go in any time, whether it was day and night, to feed them.</p><br/><p>At this rate, it\u2019ll become a chicken farm.</p><br/><p>While I was filling their food trough, Gyeoul<sup>{1}</sup>, who was refilling their water tank, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, there\u2019s a girl named Lee Seolin in my class. Her dream is becoming a girl group idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe auditioned to become a W&amp;U trainee this time, but she was contacted that she was rejected at the first stage. She came over to me crying, asking me to talk to you. So, about that, can you call her once?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, my god. I didn\u2019t think that I would receive audition requests from my own niece.</p><br/><p>I looked at her round, earnest eyes before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cGyeoul, life is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you tell her to stop dreaming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really mean. Not long ago, she was bullying my friends, and now, she clings to me, telling me that she\u2019s going to become a girl group idol. Hah, so annoying. Can\u2019t you tell her to stop dreaming, wash her feet and sleep? Huh? Please?\u201d</p><br/><p>She grumbled while brushing her short hair over her ear. It seemed like it was only yesterday when she was childish and immature, but when did she start talking about screwing others over with such finesse? This was a great stride.</p><br/><p>When I stared at her in a new light, she blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just thinking that you\u2019ve grown. It seems you all can have 1 chicken each.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s life. You\u2019re thirty this year. Dozen eggs!\u201d</p><br/><p>She said as she giggled, holding eggs hens had laid.</p><br/><p>Thirty. Ah, that\u2019s right. I\u2019ll be thirty this year.</p><br/><p>I felt a bit off earlier this year, but I had completely forgotten about this with all the work I had to deal with. It wasn\u2019t like there was a big difference between twenty-nine and thirty besides the first digit changing. Looking back, I simply felt like I lived a busy life in my late twenties.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s bird poop on the eggs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEww!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gyeoul quickly passed the eggs to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle! Uncle! We caught worms!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEww, so gross! But they\u2019re huge! Oh, but so gross!\u201d</p><br/><p>The remaining quadruplets rushed over. They must have dug up the worms in the wet mud as their clothes were caked in it. Kaeul was carrying a bowl of worms in front of him. I thought they would only have two or three, but it was wriggling with them. They deserved to be proud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you catch so many of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe plum grove over there! Grandpa told us where we could catch a lot of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEww, catching them was so gross!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy were you catching them when they are so gross?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo give to the chicks! It\u2019s nutritious. They are pitiful for only eating feed all the time!\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know about that. I didn\u2019t think they really need any more nutrition.</p><br/><p>The quadruplets entered the area specially fenced out for the chicks in the chicken coop before dropping the bowl of worms. Having discovered the special meal, the almost fully-grown chickens rushed out with their beaks pointed. The quadruplets screamed as they rushed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle! What the heck are they? Where are the chicks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the chicks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t chicks, they\u2019re chickens! They fit in the palm of my hand when I saw them last month?! Their feathers were soft and warm. They were real chicks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey grew that big after eating feed all day. Pitifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Grandma said that they were still babies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, she was lying.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was getting hard to fool them as they developed, but they were completely tricked this time. Seeing their devastated faces, like they had seen their country fall, I laughed. It felt like all my built-up stress was being washed away.</p><br/><p>I took a few eggs and returned home. They were already chatting and having a laugh at how the quadruplets were fooled.</p><br/><p>We had chicken noodle soup for lunch.<sup>{2}</sup> We also had fried some eggs to make it a meal. I bit into some ripe plums for dessert. Their sour juice spread in my mouth. With the fan blowing at me while I ate plums, this was heaven.</p><br/><p>My mother poked a piece of plum with her fork as she mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been since we gathered like this besides holidays?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came quite often. It\u2019s just hard to see Sunwoo\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo, are you eating well? Don\u2019t skip meals. Make sure you\u2019re eating. You need to take care of yourself at your age.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty is still considered young these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActual young folks don\u2019t say that. The plums at the back are tasty, do you want to take a few boxes home? Your brother already ate two boxes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cleared them as soon as we opened them. I keep craving sour things these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone became quiet at my sister-in-law\u2019s words. Scared eyes glanced at her flat stomach, and they finally became relieved when she waved her hands in denial and laughed. After becoming pregnant with quadruplets, pregnancies were a sensitive subject in our family.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>My father avoided the piece of plum my mother gave him as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are you going back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be going soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mother joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will you come back once you leave today? You\u2019re coming for Thanksgiving, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, I\u2019ll try to take as much time off as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop pestering him and let him be. His work is important, especially now that he\u2019s a team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mother sulked at my father\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd is family not important? I can\u2019t even see my son besides on holidays.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the chicken coop and see how big the chicks have gotten. Just think of them as family.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mother wielded her fork once more. The piece of plum eventually made it into my father\u2019s mouth. Seeing my father scrunch up from the sourness, I suddenly remembered what my brother told me.</p><br/><p>That our father has been lonely since recovering his health.</p><br/><p>It was also why he began growing chicks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll visit often.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said this while looking at my parents, my father coughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tell us before you come. I\u2019ll grab a chicken and cook chicken soup.<sup>{3}</sup>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to cook them even though you said to think of them as family? It looks like you still care about your son more.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mother snorted. My brother and sister-in-law laughed as well.</p><br/><p>I leisurely leaned against the sofa. I looked at my family gathered around me and the quadruplets watching an entertainment show on TV before staring at the slow, tranquil countryside outside the window.</p><br/><p>My break was over.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I entered the grey building in Cheongdam-dong.</p><br/><p>Having returned to work after a few days, it was still busy as ever and filled with life. My heart began to beat faster. My belly grew hot.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, the City Jungle marketing agency wants a meeting with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe company in charge of handling the crowdfunding is also causing a fuss, asking a ton of questions\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJoowon! They say his film shoots are going to be delayed in China! He has a commercial shoot immediately though. They\u2019re saying that they can\u2019t delay either, so what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>My employees rushed over and reported as though they had been waiting for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is there such a fuss as soon as I arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, can I add to that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone came over. It was Chief Lee Bongjoon, who had been going to and from China and Japan these days. While greeting him, I placed my bag on my desk when another employee rushed in while holding his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, there\u2019s trouble on set and they are looking for you! The road manager says he can\u2019t take it any longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee nodded. Chief Lee Bongjoon chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung? She\u2019s the same as ever, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee replied with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Chief Lee Bongjoon blinked his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha? What about her?\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Just a reminder \u2013 Bom, Yeoleum, Kaeul, and Gyeoul are the names of Jung Sunwoo\u2019s quadruplet nephews and nieces.

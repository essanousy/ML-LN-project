What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame thing we see all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon hung his arm on Chief Lee Bongjoon\u2019s shoulder as he laughed.</p><br/><p>Relieved that the mood was more easygoing than she expected, Seo Eunkyo quickly transformed her \u2018I\u2019m screwed\u2019 expression into an impatient chihuahua\u2019s. Her wagging tail was more vigorous than when she was in front of Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now that my relationship with Son Chaeyoung is a goner, let\u2019s get close to Seo Jijoon!\u2019</p><br/><p>Her eyes were filled with such desires.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo was about to say something when Seo Jijoon casually said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, so embarrassing in another country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why are you embarrassed? Because you\u2019re both Korean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have the same last name as well, hyung. And our last name isn\u2019t common!\u201d <sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. It must be a little embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t specifically mention who it was, it was clear who they were referring to.</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo\u2019s face reddened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>His one cheek bulging, perhaps because of candy, Im Joowon clicked his tongue. His sullen gaze landed on Seo Jijoon for a moment before returning.</p><br/><p>\u201cAct in moderation. It\u2019s pitiful if your jealousy becomes excessive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The whites in her eyes bloodshot, Seo Eunkyo shot a look at the weasel team leader. Though it looked like she was asking for help, the team leader was currently being ripped apart by Kim Hyunjo. In fact, Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung also added a few things.</p><br/><p>And I, well, I just watched.</p><br/><p>Since everything was proceeding as expected.</p><br/><p>In the end, the weasel team leader and chief dragged Seo Eunkyo, who was trembling in rage, and fled as if escaping. I waved my hand at them because Seo Eunkyo was looking back at me with a furious expression. Well, could this be considered a pleasant conclusion?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had it tough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo slapped my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI encounter all sorts of incidents while all the way here in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese incidents are frequent as you work. You know the saying, \u2018fight between children become fights between their parents.\u2019 Fights between celebrities become fights between managers in this industry. You\u2019ll probably be in more tough fights from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who can\u2019t handle it all quit, and in the end, this industry becomes bustling with those skilled in psychological warfare. I used to be innocent too, just this industry made me like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult for a flower cultivated in a greenhouse like me to endure this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said jokingly, but Kim Hyunjo became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re meant for this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely. Jung Sunwoo is a promising talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon nodded with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet 500 won that he\u2019ll endure this industry until he\u2019s being called CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI call and raise it 500 won.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon said, giggling.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside. The girls are waiting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was saying while glancing inside the restaurant before stopping.</p><br/><p>The girls, who had been staring at me with big, bright eyes, were paying attention to something else with awkward expressions. In front of hem stood a well-built man in a suit.</p><br/><p>Holding Lee Songha\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Who the hell was he?</p><br/><p>With no time to think about it, I entered the restaurant.</p><br/><p>Then I grabbed the unknown man\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls looked relieved when they saw me.</p><br/><p>Seeing them like that, I grabbed him even more tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was Chinese. As soon as he was grabbed by me, he stuttered in Chinese before retreating back when he looked behind me. Hearing noises behind me, it seemed that the others came in right after me.</p><br/><p>Just then, Im Seoyoung waved her hands and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah! It\u2019s nothing weird, oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee calmly explained,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person\u2019s son is eight years old and is apparently a huge fan of Songha. Since he was having a tantrum about getting her autograph, he came to ask if it was okay to receive one autograph. We refused everyone up until now so we were concerned there might be problems if we made an exception for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why was he holding her hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, he wasn\u2019t holding her hand. She was receiving a present. Fu Ling Bing<sup>{1}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha opened her hand to reveal a round, flat pancake-like snack.</p><br/><p>I let out a short sigh. My body must have reacted first because I had seen a ton of fanatical fans rushing over.</p><br/><p>The man was so surprised that he was hiccupping. I asked Lee Taehee, who was the best at Chinese among the members, to translate and apologize to the man. We also decided to give him a signed CD in secret.</p><br/><p>That was how we settled the problem.</p><br/><p>Im Joowon stared at me as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, why didn\u2019t you scare Seo Eunkyo with that scary expression? Then I bet she would be too scared to pick a fight with you next time. You\u2019re really sca\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon stopped mid-sentence and look around.</p><br/><p>Then he suddenly began laughing. He was laughing even why coughing, seemingly having almost choked on his candy. At this rate, he might end up crying.</p><br/><p>Laughing, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWith a group like this, I bet we will have no more trouble dealing with fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know about the bouquet effect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it used for idol groups? If a few pretty idols grouped together, they would look much prettier than being on their own.</p><br/><p>But why was he bringing that up now?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is exactly the opposite of the bouquet effect. Since we have a group of scary-looking people, we look ten times more menacing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon gestured to Chief Sung.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, Chief Sung looks like a fox that\u2019s more prickly than sandpaper.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if acknowledging it, Chief Sung\u2019s eyes narrowed into crescents as he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Chief Kim looks like a walking zombie. Chief Lee looks like a bandit when he\u2019s expressionless. Also, this large manager just has droopy eyes. If he wears sunglasses, he\u2019ll look just like a gangster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon, who looked at Kim Hyunjo, Chief Lee Bongjoon, and Lee Kwanwoo in order, lastly held my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Chief Jung is unrivalled. A big shot amongst scary-looking fellows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neptune held their bellies and laughed when they heard him. Seo Jijoon had already been laughing so hard that it made one concerned about his breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally! It\u2019ll be difficult to gather a group like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t agree.</p><br/><p>Just by looks, the celebrities weren\u2019t that far off either.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha and LJ looked aloof, and Lee Taehee usually had an indifferent expression. Seo Jijoon was the embodiment of a cold, city man. Im Joowon was slick and handsome but felt thorny.</p><br/><p>To be honest, the only one who looked pure and innocent among us was Im Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>When I said this, the chiefs laughed up a storm.</p><br/><p>I was worried that the mood would be awkward since it was our first time gathering like this, but I was worried for nothing as our table was constantly bustling with laughter like a team that got along really well.</p><br/><p>While laughing with them, I suddenly had a thought.</p><br/><p>I hoped that the team I made had such a good atmosphere.</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>A warm, dry voice rang in my ears.</p><br/><p>Leaning against the restaurant entrance, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. I was having dinner but called because I thought of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear staff bustling around in the background from the other end of the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you filming right now? It seems I\u2019m bothering you while you\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s fine. I am waiting on set.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the atmosphere on the film set? I couldn\u2019t go so I\u2019m dying from curiosity.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t stick with Nam Joyoon due to circumstances, but I planned on being there when they started filming. They just had to start the day after I went to Beijing.</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s fun. Getting ready, acting, and even waiting on set. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve worked on such a large-scale commercial film so it\u2019s interesting as well.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s voice heated up when he started talking about the shoot.</p><br/><p>The corners of my lips unconsciously rose when I felt his faint excitement.</p><br/><p>What kind of reactions did the staff have when they saw Nam Joyoon act?</p><br/><p>I admired it multiple times while we were reading the script together and I was watching him practice. It was enough that my confidence in my discerning eye reached the skies.</p><br/><p>Damn it. I wanted to see it with my own eyes.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon acting in front of the camera.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you lacking anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I already have more than enough. Thanks to the stylist and makeup artist you introduced me to, I\u2019m having a comfortable time filming. Also, the director and production staff are treating me very well.</p><br/><p>That was good. Without a company or a manager next to him to take care of things, I was most worried that a complication would arise on set.</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t have had this worry if Nam Joyoon signed with W&amp;U. Thinking about the Team 2 Leader made me frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this movie is a success, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I swallowed my next words.</p><br/><p>He was someone who was turned away after an interview. I didn\u2019t want to give him false hopes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Don\u2019t starve, and make sure to take care of yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>-You don\u2019t need to worry about me. You must have more than enough on your plate in China.</p><br/><p>I resolved myself while listening to Nam Joyoon\u2019s subdued voice.</p><br/><p>If this movie was a success and Nam Joyoon\u2019s performance was acknowledged by others, then I would take proper action. I couldn\u2019t continue this vague relationship.</p><br/><p>I turned my gaze while thinking about officially working with Nam Joyoon. I saw Neptune and the others laughing and chatting.</p><br/><p>I laughed silently.</p><br/><p>I could faintly see the outline of my team.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I looked around while being guided by an employee.</p><br/><p>I heard it was a luxurious bar operating on a membership system. The decorations were as extravagant as the hotel. The soundproofing was perfect too. We passed a few rooms as we walked down the hallway, but all I heard was the employee and my footsteps.</p><br/><p>Soon, the employee stopped in front of a black door.</p><br/><p>When I opened the door and entered, I couldn\u2019t help but gape.</p><br/><p>Although I\u2019ve visited various bars while working, this was my first time seeing such a luxurious room. From ceiling to floor, the entire room was an odd mixture of black and red. The dim lights above floated around like the aurora lights.</p><br/><p>Did the alcohol taste exceptional if you drank in a place like this?</p><br/><p>I licked my lips as I looked around. The table was already set with alcohol and side dishes.</p><br/><p>Yet there was no one here.</p><br/><p>I heard that he had already arrived and was waiting for me. Did he leave for a bit?</p><br/><p>Just as I sat down on a sofa that felt amazing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wh-what a surprise.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, someone raised their body from the seat of honor, which had been covered by the table. Perhaps he had been lying down all this time, but his always cleanly brushed hair was slightly disheveled.</p><br/><p>The man searched the desk then put on his newly found glasses.</p><br/><p>He was the employee from the Chinese agency contracted with W&amp;U. His name was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe met last time. I am Lee Lyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I am Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for coming here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why is there so much alcohol if it\u2019s just us two?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, glancing at the table.</p><br/><p>I was planning on getting on good terms with him after a few hours of drinking and learning a lot about how the Chinese entertainment industry ran. We couldn\u2019t drink all of this even if we spent all night here.</p><br/><p>I had heard that the Chinese liked to treat people extravagantly.</p><br/><p>The corners of Lee Lyang\u2019s lips curled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we can\u2019t drink this all by ourselves. People who will drink with us will arrive soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he said this, the door opened once more.</p><br/><p>When I saw fluttering cheongsam<sup>{3}</sup>, the world suddenly became quiet.</p><br/><p>My vision was clear and static-free.</p><br/><p>This place looked vintage yet different. I was with Director Park and Reporter Song.</p><br/><p>Even after I realized I was in the future, my mind was a mess for a moment.</p><br/><p>My attention was still on the red cheongsam I last saw.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t be like this.</p><br/><p>I suppressed the thoughts that floated in my mind. My priority right now was what kind of information I could glean from this future.</p><br/><p>My future 20 years from now.</p><br/><p>If I were to see the future again, I had hoped to learn whether Lee Songha\u2019s drama or Nam Joyoon\u2019s movie was a success or not. It looked like that would be difficult from this fixed future.</p><br/><p>Then what was it this time?</p><br/><p>I was closely examining everything in sight when my gaze suddenly turned to the side. Then the holographic window floating on the table slid in front of me.</p><br/><p>Looking at it up close, it was filled with difficult-to-understand letters and numbers.</p><br/><p>Then what looked to be photo evidence was attached at the bottom.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>My future self spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people who helped me stand here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>People who helped me stand here today?</p><br/><p>I focused my eyes as much as possible. I wanted to examine the photo as much as I could before my gaze turned away. Although I didn\u2019t know that he meant just now, either way, there was no doubt that they were related to my future self.</p><br/><p>There were young people and people who seemed quite old.</p><br/><p>And\u2026 There were familiar faces as well.</p><br/><p>Him. A middle-aged man wearing unusual glasses. Although he aged a bit and he looked a little different, he was the Chinese agency employee, Lee Lyang, who I had just seen before.</p><br/><p>And next to him was the Team 2 Leader, who now had grey hair. Damn it.</p><br/><p>There was one more person.</p><br/><p>He left a favorable impression and had a picturesque smile.</p><br/><p>He looked like the traitor.</p><br/><p>No, wait. He didn\u2019t look like him but was an older Choi Gunyoung no matter how I looked at him.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>What kind of damn group was this? Were they the people on my life\u2019s blacklist?</p><br/><p>I was blankly looking at the hologram when my future self smiled and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, they are my team members.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Many Koreans share the same last name \u2013 most common last names are Lee, Park, Kim</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> Fu Ling Bing \u2013 Chinese pancake-like snack</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> Cheongsam \u2013 traditional Chinese dress</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-127\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 127\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-129\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 129\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201369\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

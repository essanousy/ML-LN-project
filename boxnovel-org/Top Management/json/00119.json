A gigantic one.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Big news! Did you read the article published by Star Search?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one where Park Dojin was caught smoking drugs by the paparazzi? Who hasn\u2019t seen that? The photo evidence was absolute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two women chatted while getting on the elevator. It wasn\u2019t strange. Park Dojin\u2019s drug scandal swept through the country and abroad as soon as it was published. It was a hot topic online and offline.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was something about a police investigation. Do you think he\u2019ll go to jail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge fuss about it in China. He\u2019s completely doomed with this scandal. I bet he would have to pay tens of billions of won in damages once he\u2019s cut from national and international advertisements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were almost pulled into it too. The Content Department was planning on signing him for a new proj-\u201c</p><br/><p>The whispering woman stopped talking once she glanced at me.</p><br/><p>She tilted her head as she looked at me. Her expression showed that she saw me from somewhere.</p><br/><p>Were sunglasses no longer enough? Did I have to wear surgical masks and hats like celebrities?</p><br/><p>The elevator soon arrived on the eighth floor. I checked the panel that read \u2018Well-Made Production Content Production Department\u2019 and got off. As expected of a place that had been directly hit by a hurricane, everyone was unbelievably busy.</p><br/><p>I looked around when I heard a voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, I came to meet Director Sung. To show him our rookies.\u201d</p><br/><p>A female employee sighed when she heard the glasses-wearing man in his late thirties then she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, but I couldn\u2019t get in contact with him because he\u2019s so busy. I came over to say hello since I\u2019ve also done a project with Director Sung in the past. If you just give me ten minutes, I just want to show him our rookies\u2019 profiles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you leave me your contact information, I\u2019ll pass it onto him. He currently can\u2019t meet anyone because he\u2019s busy dealing with an internal matter. He even canceled all the meetings he had scheduled today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The speaking employee glanced at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what is the purpose for your visit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also came to see Director Sung, but I\u2019ll schedule another date then.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to turn back when the employee\u2019s eyes widened as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me! Please wait! Are you Jung-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud voice erupted behind me. When I turned around, Director Sung, the marketing lead, and a few other employees were making their way towards me. The black beneath their eyes showed they were firmly struggling with the Park Dojin scandal.</p><br/><p>Director Sung placed his hand on my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have called me when you were downstairs! Then I would have sent someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I just came up because you were in the middle of a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was calming our Chinese investors. Let\u2019s not stay standing and go over to our meeting room.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gestured with his hand and led the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Sung, I was in AAP Entertainment in the past\u2026\u201c</p><br/><p>The glasses-wearing man hurriedly introduced himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to introduce you to the rookies I\u2019ve been taking care of for Royal Family. Ten minutes, no, if you just give me five minutes-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m too busy right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung said while clicking his tongue. A male employee next to him joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the directing team casts for minor roles and extras, if you give us their profiles, I\u2019ll send them there. If the directing team finds anyone they like, they\u2019ll contact you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The glasses-wearing man clung and attempted to ask Director Sung to lend him a bit of his time a few more times, but he handed the file containing the profiles to the male employee in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if it\u2019s a minor role with no dialogue. Please!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>I coincidentally met his gaze. When I greeted him, a deep valley appeared between his brows. He looked at me for a moment with mixed emotions before greeting me as well. Then he turned around and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I entered a large meeting room, Director Sung personally pulled out a chair for me.</p><br/><p>Director Sung, the marketing lead, and the other Well-Made Production employees sat across from me. All had smiling faces. Director Sung shook his head as he grasped my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly indebted to you. If we cast Park Dojin, broadcasted the drama, and the scandal broke out then, we would have all been screwed. I was scared to death. Just thinking about it makes my vision go black.\u201d</p><br/><p>His stumpy fingers tap on the back of my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, while we\u2019re proceeding with the project, let me know anytime if you need anything. I will consider you as my number 1 priority.\u201d</p><br/><p>I made a wry smile inwardly. I smirked just thinking about how Director Sung would have treated me if I didn\u2019t tell him about Park Dojin\u2019s scandal in advance.</p><br/><p>It probably wouldn\u2019t be much different from the glasses-wearing man from before. No, since I was useful as a way of promotion, I probably would have been treated better than that. Anyways, every day in this industry was a rollercoaster.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t like I wasn\u2019t aware of that.</p><br/><p>I smiled as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, without refusing, should we talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll consider that you consent to adjusting the schedule like so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the readily nodding Director Sung, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I also heard you were accepting demo tracks for the OST.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve almost received a hundred songs already. We need to pick good songs if we\u2019re going to line them up on the music charts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you decide on your lineup of singers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. We want to cast talented singers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He trailed off, seemingly having understood my intentions.</p><br/><p>I took out a USB drive from my bag and handed it to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Lee Taehee, the leader of Neptune. She\u2019s really great at singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I heard Satellite. The one that\u2019s been stuck at first on the music charts for weeks now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaehee\u2019s the one who wrote and composed that song. I thought it would be difficult for you to properly judge her singing talent because Neptune songs are divided into different parts so I added a few solo cover songs Taehee sang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung licked his lips as he received the USB drive.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be great for marketing since she\u2019s in the same group as Ms. Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a waste to use her only for marketing. I\u2019m not so stubborn as to ask you to give a track to someone without talent. Whoever the album lineup consists of, she won\u2019t drag you down. Listen to it with the music director and contact me if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said smoothly. Director Sung\u2019s complexion brightened. Since he owed me a huge favor, he\u2019d probably give me a track if I pushed him, but there was no reason to reduce his debt with this.</p><br/><p>Since the mood was positive, after setting things up like this, I was confident everything else would fall into place with her talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do that. I have a lot of trust in your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung said while laughing.</p><br/><p>I suddenly heard a vibration. The employees, who had been listening to Director Sung and my conversation, read the mood as they quickly checked their phones. I took out my phone to check whether it was mine as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The marketing lead apologized.</p><br/><p>That moment, there was another phone vibrated. And another, phones vibrated here and there. The phone in my hand was vibrating as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god. A scandal. Another scandal broke out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The marketing lead, who was the first to check, shouted.</p><br/><p>Director Sung was surprised like someone sick of scandals.</p><br/><p>\u201cA scandal? Why? Did Park Dojin do something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not Park Dojin. Oh my god. What\u2019s this? I thought that Park Dojin\u2019s scandal would be the biggest one this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? A different scandal broke out? Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The marketing lead glanced at me.</p><br/><p>I soon understood what scandal this woman was referring to.</p><br/><p>\u201cSung Dowon.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected.</p><br/><p>When I checked my phone, I was contacted by Reporter Park Woojeong, Kim Hyunjo, and a few others. When I checked the attached URL Kim Hyunjo sent me, it was an article with the word \u2018Exclusive\u2019 in huge letters in its headline.</p><br/><p>It mentioned Sung Dowon\u2019s dirty private life, one where he secretly attends sex parties and acted perverted. It also clearly summarized his problems with Pure Star, his previous company.</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung, that woman. She was quick to investigate.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see. I had confirmed that his exclusive contract with W&amp;U had long since been dissolved. No one knew that I had figured out Sung Dowon\u2019s secret, and obviously, they wouldn\u2019t know that I made a deal with the paparazzi.</p><br/><p>Though the quick-witted CEO Baek Hansung did linger in my mind\u2026</p><br/><p>While thinking this, I received a call. It was Jung Hyesung. I excused myself from Director Sung, who was murmuring while reading the article, and exited the meeting room. I immediately answered the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>-The article\u2019s been published.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I saw it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I swallowed my urge to say that I didn\u2019t expect it to be released so soon.</p><br/><p>-Even though you said it was a time bomb that could explode at any time, I didn\u2019t know it would explode this quickly. Did you leak this information to them as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>-That article. It was G-Today who broke the news.</p><br/><p>What did she say?</p><br/><p>I quickly checked the article. The site address and the press mentioned in the author line wasn\u2019t DM Media. There wasn\u2019t any mention of Star Search either.</p><br/><p>It was G-Today. The publication where Reporter Park Woojeong worked.</p><br/><p>-I was curious if you leaked the information to that rookie reporter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><br/><p>I clearly said.</p><br/><p>Did the new break out because it was naturally time to like in the original future?</p><br/><p>Director Park from the future didn\u2019t mention that the scandal was published by her publication. Then did the future change? Why? If it changed, I assumed it was definitely because of Jung Hyesung. Why was it G-Today all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>-Since it\u2019s already done, I\u2019ll take my hands off Sung Dowon\u2019s matter.</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung said in a mumbling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that I gave you information that was too close to its expiry date.\u201d</p><br/><p>-It wasn\u2019t a bad deal. We confirmed that your information is real and that it was even a huge deal. Let\u2019s help each other from now on. I want to be one of your \u2018friends with good hearing\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Especially being friends with a reporter, more so if she was a member of the paparazzi that took quick actions.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, I called Reporter Park Woojeong this time.</p><br/><p>When I brought up Sung Dowon, Reporter Park Woojeong was restless as she said.</p><br/><p>-I would have let you know if I knew about it ahead of time, but this isn\u2019t something we personally cover. It suddenly landed on our director\u2019s hands today and was immediately sent to the desk. I only read it after it was released.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes, it\u2019s true!</p><br/><p>After exchanging a few more words, I hung up.</p><br/><p>I heard people murmuring. When I looked around, people were talking about Sung Dowon with surprised faces in the meeting room and even the office through the hallway.</p><br/><p>I rolled my phone in my hand a few times.</p><br/><p>Then I brushed away all the thoughts that filled my head.</p><br/><p>When and how didn\u2019t matter. What would have inevitably gotten out had simply been published.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cBut can Ms. Songha really not fit it in her schedule? If possible, as a regular member.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because she was fully dressed up and in full makeup for the script reading session, but the producer couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. Her schedule is packed until later this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while wetting my lips with coffee. The americano from the coffee shop inside the PBS broadcasting station was horrible. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the producer had bought it, I wouldn\u2019t even put my lips on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, Songha specializes in acting and performances. To put her as a regular member in a talk show panel is a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why? I saw the entertainment shows she was in when they aired and she seemed fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was just a guest and it worked out because the producers edited her parts well. She\u2019ll run out of material if she became a regular on a talk show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha glanced at me from the side while chewing on a gummy worm. Her expression showed that she was confident in entertainment and even culture programs, but in an internal meeting, we decided to have her abstain from TV appearances as much as we could.</p><br/><p>This was a world where they caught every single word people say and criticize them for it.</p><br/><p>It was uneasy to have Lee Songha be a regular member of a talk show.</p><br/><p>\u201cEntertainment shows are Seoyoung\u2019s specialty. If you put her with LJ, their chemistry is very good. Since they watch your show every week, they\u2019ll adjust well too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s try an episode with the two of them as guests and decide whether to cast them as regulars after that. Also, there\u2019s a segment where they call celebrities they are close with, will they be able to call some high-level celebrities?\u201d</p><br/><p>High-level celebrities? Though Seo Jijoon told me to use him once whenever we needed him, it was waste to use him for this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Mr. Im Joowon. They\u2019ve been on an entertainment show together so they are familiar with each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIm Joowon\u2019s good. He went to W&amp;U, correct? He\u2019s even working on Ms. Songha\u2019s project.\u201d</p><br/><p>I glanced at my watch while replying. It was already 10:30 am.</p><br/><p>I told the recruit who was sipping hot chocolate at the table next to us,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Kwanwoo, take Songha up first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still some time left, should we go already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Since she\u2019s a rookie, it\u2019s best to be early. Veteran actors could arrive early as well. Go up early, Songha. I\u2019ll come after the meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, oppa. I\u2019ll save you a spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha took her gummy worms and got up.</p><br/><p>When the two left the coffee shop, the producer licked his lips in pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was a delight to my eyes. There\u2019s a Royal Family script reading today, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. A script reading and a ritual<sup>{1}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the big Chinese investors continued to cause a commotion because of Park Dojin\u2019s scandal, we had to push the schedule forward. Apparently, there would be a poster shoot in China in two days after the script reading and ritual today.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four leads are Ms. Songha, Im Joowon, Yoon Taekyung, and Seo Eunkyo? The cast is incredible. But it really is best for Ms. Songha to go up early. Before she gets scolded. You have to be especially careful of Seo Eunkyo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard a few things while looking into it, but is it that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer was astonished at my question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious? She appeared on my program as a guest before, and I really had a hard time. Her fierce temper is no joke. She probably took down a few of her juniors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, Lee Songha was someone who even threw a cake at Son Chaeyoung. Since she became used to dealing with the crazy bitch at home without intending to, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be shocked or discouraged by other actresses picking a fight with her.</p><br/><p>The producer continued with a meaningful expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the trait of actors. \u2018I need to stand out the most.\u2019 Especially since Ms. Songha became an instant star from an unknown rookie, she\u2019ll probably be jealous of her as well. She\u2019s probably waiting for a chance to take her down a notch from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was a bit worried. Should I have gone up with her even if we were a little late?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s finish up this casting matter in ten minutes and go up.</p><br/><p>Nothing would happen in only ten minutes, right?</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> A shamanistic ritual for good luck.</p><br/><p>TL/N: Side note, the paparazzi woman\u2019s name was changed to \u2018Jung Hyeyoung\u2019 in the raws. I kept it \u2018Jung Hyesung\u2019 for the sake of consistency. Please let me know if I accidentally write \u2018Jung Hyeyoung\u2019.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-118\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 118\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-120\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 120\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201351\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

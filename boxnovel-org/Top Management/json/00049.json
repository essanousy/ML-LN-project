Although there are still more who are criticizing us, luckily, Neptune gained the image of a skilled idol group, and because Songha is so pretty, the number of people protecting</p><br/><p>her is steadily increasing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she answered, the team 3 leader added in with dry lips,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people who are being quiet, saying that they\u2019ll talk after seeing her act. Fortunately, if there was only bad public criticism, then she may have had to quit the drama. Since TVL wouldn\u2019t keep Songha in that situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that, but since both the criticizing side and protecting side are quite equal, there\u2019s no hint the</p><br/><p>controversy will die down soon. Since both sides are taking turns adding fuel to the fire,\u201d</p><br/><p>Added Kim Hyunjo. CEO Baek Hansung asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first broadcast is in January, and the script reading is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn four days, on the 24th.\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered this time. Since it was a day I was impatiently waiting for since I wrote it in my schedule, the answer came out immediately.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s gaze momentarily fell on me before turning away.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s raise the stakes. Let\u2019s see how high they go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet in contact with TVL and ask them about making a behind-the-scenes team\u2026 A team that keeps the</p><br/><p>behind-the-scenes camera rolling during the script reading, poster photo shoot, the actual filming, then creates and releases teasers one after another\u2026 No, I\u2019ll make a personal visit to TVL.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director cut in with a sour expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cA behind-the-scenes or teaser, at most, they\u2019ll be 30-60 seconds. You probably won\u2019t be able to tell if she\u2019s good at acting with that? We won\u2019t be able to put the controversy to rest like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople will continue to watch if they can\u2019t tell. Since they are curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cControversy is interest, and if we can drag this interest properly until January\u2026 I think the ratings for the first broadcast won\u2019t lose to public networks. Also, if the project is good, then it\u2019ll ride the flow from</p><br/><p>there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at CEO Baek Hansung with unblinking eyes.</p><br/><p>I thought the same thing as well.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, when Lee Songha\u2019s name first started to rise in the rankings.</p><br/><p>Cable channels were less accessible compared to public networks. Unlike public network dramas that are guaranteed at least 3% viewership ratings with no promotions, it was considered a success if cable dramas hit 3% viewership ratings after constantly promoting the drama a month before.</p><br/><p>Dramas, that failed to become a hot topic but were good quality, hovered at around 1% and would only be acknowledged by those who watched them.</p><br/><p>However, the situation would change if it could become a hot topic.</p><br/><p>Since, as long as it became a hot topic and the content possessed sufficient mass appeal and quality, people would watch it regardless of whether it was on cable or not. As proof of this, there were dramas that surpassed 10%, which was considered to be a limit of cable channels, after becoming a craze on the internet and heated topics in forums and community sites.</p><br/><p>That was why, since there already was a controversy, I thought that if we looked at this positively, this controversy, this hot topic, could become the driving force in making people anticipate and wait for Cat Guardian Ghost.</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t tell others, who were worried, my thoughts.</p><br/><p>It was because there were two reasons that made me think this.</p><br/><p>One was that I continuously confirmed Lee Songha\u2019s remarkable acting skills and concentration while we read the script together for the past few weeks. The other reason was that I knew</p><br/><p>that there was a very, very high chance that the project, Cat Guardian Ghost,</p><br/><p>would become a hit.</p><br/><p>That was why I thought that if I told people, who weren\u2019t aware of this, my thoughts, they would say I was optimistic like LJ did.</p><br/><p>How was it that this person could make decisions like this just by looking at her audition tape?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we do that and things go bad, the backlash will be quite big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yeah, that is a normal reaction.</p><br/><p>When the director began to talk, even Team Leader Park said with a worried face,</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the risk\u2026 too high? Of course, if we can continue to drag this controversy like you say, the</p><br/><p>viewership rating for the first broadcast may outdo the ones from public networks, but everyone will be watching with the intention of dissecting Lee Songha\u2019s acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director, team 3 leader, and Kim Hyunjo all nodded their heads in agreement.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, people who were swearing at her will be prepared in front of their TVs to look for any faults in her acting with the attitude of \u2018Let\u2019s see how good you really are\u2019. If Songha makes even a small mistake, they\u2019ll create a fuss and claim, \u2018I knew it!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader joined in immediately,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will be a huge pressure on Songha as well. Although she\u2019s better than I thought, there are times when even veterans can\u2019t display their full abilities under pressure. Moreover, this is</p><br/><p>her first project. If she makes the slightest mistake\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to do well. And the actress needs to act well.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung looked at me again and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the manager needs to take proper care.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meeting continued for some time.</p><br/><p>Other people, including the director, once again voiced their concerns, but in the end, it was decided that CEO Baek Hansung would be personally going to TVL and meeting with CEO Kim Pansuk, Director Shin Taekyun, and their director.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park rubbed her face with her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaintain the balance of the controversy while dragging it until January\u2026 My shoulders are heavy. It\u2019ll be a delicate situation until the drama\u2019s first broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it looks like it\u2019ll die down, let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung laughed in a low</p><br/><p>voice and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019If she was someone who wasn\u2019t good at acting, I wouldn\u2019t have even gotten her to audition.\u2019 Or \u2018If I</p><br/><p>were to add her to a drama, do you think TVL\u2019s my limit?\u2019 How do they sound? I think it will heat things up if I throw it out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone listened to him with frightened expressions before realizing it was a joke at the end.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park relaxed her shoulders and grinned,</p><br/><p>\u201cThings will heat up for sure. The company will be burned black. I\u2019ll do what I can so you don\u2019t have to do an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then work hard, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it looked like the meeting was wrapping up, I picked up my laptop that was lying on the table. Then I got up to follow Kim Hyunjo out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not busy, I\u2019d like to talk to you for a bit,\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said suddenly.</p><br/><p>When I looked around, unsure whether he was talking to me, I saw that everyone was staring at me.</p><br/><p>Even the CEO.</p><br/><p>Me?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have one more thing I want to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied first before sitting back down. Everyone left one after another with an expression that looked like they were so curious they could die. Finally, Kim Hyunjo pointed his thumb downwards as if gesturing me to meet him downstairs before leaving.</p><br/><p>The only ones remaining in the CEO\u2019s office was CEO Baek Hansung and me. A silence hung in the air.</p><br/><p>What is this?</p><br/><p>What does he want to ask me?</p><br/><p>Is it about the drama? Or about Lee Songha?</p><br/><p>Just when I was thinking of various situations in order to give a perfect reply no matter the question, a question I didn\u2019t think of was asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know about Sung Dowon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026. Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you refuse because you knew?\u201d</p><br/><p>My mind blanked momentarily before turning at full speed.</p><br/><p>I knew that Sung Dowon only looked normal on the outside, but was very problematic inside. Well, it had already been a while since that day. I did think that W&amp;U already knew about it since they said that W&amp;U dropped him before Pure Star and Sung Dowon started to accuse one another in the future I saw.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>I feigned ignorance and lied.</p><br/><p>If I acted like I knew, then it would become a headache if he started to ask me how I knew.</p><br/><p>When I looked at him as casually as I could, CEO Baek Hansung revealed a subtle expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cA coincidence, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He tapped his long finger on the sofa\u2019s armrest again.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like I was being interrogated, but I felt suffocated.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, I was able to keep a calm expression like now because my first month at work was so spectacular, and above all, my mentality grew multiple times stronger after getting my foresight ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung broke the silence as he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you were the one who brought this drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was a good drama and requested Team Leader Park for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I give you if this really is a success\u2026 If there\u2019s something you need, let me know then. I need to keep those with good luck next to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He grinned as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, go own your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was picking up my laptop again, I heard CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s voice again,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. Also, about Lee Songha. Continue to stay by her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stay by her?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare for actors and actresses to endure the pressure, stress, and responsibility from acting like it\u2019s nothing. So the majority try to depend on something. It can be drugs or alcohol\u2026 or even people.\u201d</p><br/><p>My expression stiffened without realizing.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said in serious expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cMake her depend on you. So she doesn\u2019t turn to something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I left the CEO\u2019s office, I called Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>I felt like I could only ease the strange churning in my stomach by calling her.</p><br/><p>-Yes, this is Lee Songha\u2019s phone! Please wait a mom-</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When we told them to prevent Lee Songha from using the internet, it seemed they took her phone away as well.</p><br/><p>When I cut Im Seoyoung\u2019s familiar voice off, the other side of the phone became quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, I can hear you\u2026 Is this Sunwoo oppa? Did you call on your cell phone?</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung, it\u2019s been more than a month since we\u2019ve met, but you still don\u2019t know my voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>-No, I know. I do\u2026 The contact is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me my phone number isn\u2019t saved on Songha\u2019s phone?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt that would be a different type of shock.</p><br/><p>-No, it\u2019s saved\u2026 Anyways, I\u2019ll pass the phone to her!</p><br/><p>What was that?</p><br/><p>Her reaction was strange, but before I could get curious, I heard Lee Songha\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>-Oppa. Are you at work?</p><br/><p>Her voice sounded normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Eating.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating breakfast now?\u201d</p><br/><p>-No. I had breakfast a while ago\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then lunch?\u201d</p><br/><p>-No. We are planning on ordering pizza for lunch later.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Did you perhaps read articles on the internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>-No. Unni took away my phone. I just got it back now.</p><br/><p>That was a relief. So she wasn\u2019t eating due to stress.</p><br/><p>I sighed silently so she couldn\u2019t hear and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we hang up, give it back. Your mood will spoil if you read what they are saying on the internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m fin- I don\u2019t care. You told me not to care.</p><br/><p>The moment I heard her unhesitant reply, my lips curved upwards without realizing.</p><br/><p>Her pleasant voice continued, accompanied by a crunching sound,</p><br/><p>-I felt strange because I was cast so easily, but I finally feel that it\u2019s real. I wish time will pass quickly so we can start filming. But\u2026</p><br/><p>Lee Songha paused for a moment before asking,</p><br/><p>-Are we going to read the script today?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will. I\u2019ll go as soon as I\u2019m done here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like usual, I replied with a smile.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-48\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 48\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-50\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 50\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201210\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Noises began leaking from the silent Alive screening theatre. If they could hear noisy shouts outside, then they could guess how much a commotion there was inside. A man who paid for his popcorn brought his girlfriend over to the theatre entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see the people leaving. I\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell from the people leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can tell whether a movie was fun or boring from the audience\u2019s reaction!\u201d</p><br/><p>Other people followed suit and began glancing at the entrance, even the employees popping popcorn and pouring drinks. A Korean blockbuster that was praised by reviewers and others in the industry, the amount of interest in Alive was quite high.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet my hand that the audience didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man wearing glasses said while grabbing some popcorn from his friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cReviewers said it was good so who are you to say that it\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Reviewers hyped it up too much. The audience must have watched it expecting a Hollywood zombie movie, but that means they\u2019ll be 100% disappointed. You need to watch it thinking, \u2018This is good for a Korean movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlive also had a huge budget though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they going to do with 30 billion won? Hollywood blockbusters spend hundreds of billion won.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, then they might actually be disa-\u201c</p><br/><p>He was cut off by the commotion. Viewers poured out from the theatre entrance.</p><br/><p>Those waiting outside examined their faces. It was strange. There was some with serious expressions and others with despondent expressions. Either way, it was clear that there was a lot to talk about regarding this movie. The viewers began chatting with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI checked my phone three times at the end. To check the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too! I was wondering when it would end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was the movie boring?</p><br/><p>The people around them perked their ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI checked thinking only an hour had passed but it was almost over. I thought I was seeing things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last 30 minutes passed by like it was three minutes. 150 minutes just passed by like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy. I already want to go back in and watch it all over again. Is this normal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the same as soon as it ended. I need to watch it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people eavesdropping on their conversation exchanged looks.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 They seem to like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut your hand off, man.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who bet his hand that the viewers wouldn\u2019t like it coughed.</p><br/><p>With an incredibly curious expression, he mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did they make the movie for people to react like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s family was amongst the mass exodus of Alive viewers. They didn\u2019t say a word even though the movie had ended. With dazed expressions, they simply walked while staring at the backs of people in front of them as though they were firmly entranced by something.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Nam Joyoon\u2019s father looked beside him. Women were chatting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it? Does his name not appear? Search for \u2018Alive\u2019s crazy bastard\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on. I\u2019m searching\u2026 Huh, it looks like other people who watched the movie are looking too. There are posts wondering who the crazy bastard who threw the kid is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeeey! It\u2019s here! Under movie information, Nam Joyoon!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she shouted his name, Nam Joyoon\u2019s family flinched. Light returned to their dazed eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis profile picture looks completely normal? His \u2018crazy guy\u2019 acting in the movie was amazing though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, he\u2019s a villain yet I was completely absorbed whenever he appeared on screen. His voice was great too. Ah, it looks like he\u2019s the one reviewers have been calling the scene-stealer and new menu item. His first appearance was so thrilling it made my heart race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing him. Was he in plays before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019ll become popular with this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hiccup.</p><br/><p>A strange noise cut in. Intermixed with suppressed sobs.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s father turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, are you crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s mother shook her lowered head. However, the hiccups were undoubtedly coming from her. When gazes began to gather on her, she hastily wiped her eyes with her sleeves.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you seeing things? Who\u2019s crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are! You said I wasn\u2019t acting my age before. Joyoon, your mother is crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm not! My eyes are just dry from staring at the screen for so long!\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother slapped his father\u2019s back. Yet, despite her words, her eyes were pooling with tears. Nam Joyoon, who was throwing out the popcorn and sodas, came over with widened eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Fine, of course, I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she nodded, the tears pooling in her eyes fell. That was the start. Her dripping tears began to flow like a faucet. Her suppressed sobs and hiccups were mixed in as well. Nam Joyoon\u2019s teasing father was so shocked he shut his mouth. However, the one who was most surprised by this was the person herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, why am I like this all of a sudden?!\u201d</p><br/><p>She tried keeping her eyes open and even covering them with her palms. They were futile attempts.</p><br/><p>A couple standing in front of the entrance mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the movie is sad. That person\u2019s sobbing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? Is it like a melodrama? I can\u2019t watch movies that make you cry. Should we not watch it?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Nam Joyoon\u2019s mother heard this even while trying to stop her tears as she hurriedly waved her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t a sad movie. You can watch it. Please watch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There are almost no sad parts.\u201d</p><br/><p>The women who were talking about Nam Joyoon supported her claim.</p><br/><p>They were about to throw out their popcorn and perfectly fine napkins when someone asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThose napkins. If you\u2019re not going to use them, could I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes! Here you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the women turned around to hand it to the person.</p><br/><p>Then her eyes met\u2026</p><br/><p>The same face she saw on the screen and profile picture.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s eyes bulged. At the same time, she screamed so loudly that the viewers, who continued to walk only looking in front of them, stopped in their steps from the surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you crazy? Why are you-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her friend\u2019s mouth gaped when she saw Nam Joyoon\u2019s face. Her trembling fingers repeatedly pointed at him. It only took a moment for the other viewers to recognize his face as well. A huge commotion erupted at the theatre entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s him, right? The crazy bastard, I mean, man who threw the kid in the movie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is the actor\u2026 here? Huh? The heck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god! Did he come to see the movie with his family? Sh-should I ask for an autograph?\u201d</p><br/><p>People began to gather around Nam Joyoon\u2019s family. However, they hesitated, not rushing over to him. It wasn\u2019t because he was a celebrity. It was because his cruel character in the movie was still fresh in their minds.</p><br/><p>This was only for a moment.</p><br/><p>People began to rush towards Nam Joyoon like a swarm of zombies.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease rest here in the staff room before leaving through the emergency exit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for helping us, Mr. Manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo said while brushing his sweat-soaked hair aside.</p><br/><p>The cinema manager looked at his bare face with awe before hastily waving his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is protocol when actors come to greet people on stage. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager revealed what was in his hands. It was Alive\u2019s poster.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay, could I ask for an autograph\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s okay, could we take a picture\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager left in a happy mood after receiving Nam Joyoon\u2019s autograph and taking a picture with him. Only Jung Sunwoo and Nam Joyoon\u2019s family remained in the room. They were all trying to catch their breaths.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s family slumped down with dazed expressions like people that were pushed away during a 50% surprise sale event. His female cousin\u2019s hair, whose small figure was buried among the swarms of people, was a complete mess, and his mother\u2019s tears were no longer seen.</p><br/><p>The first one to regain his senses was Nam Joyoon\u2019s male cousin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, WOW, What the heck! Just what\u2019s going on? Is this a dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Nam Joyoon\u2019s aunt and uncle joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god. I don\u2019t even remember what happened in the movie. I just remember Joyoon\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Joyoon going to be famous now? Brother-in-law and sister-in-law, it looks like you don\u2019t need to worry any longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he becomes famous, then will he appear on morning dramas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot morning dramas, entertainment shows! Oppa might appear on entertainment shows! He might even hold fan meetings! If Joyoon oppa becomes famous, what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you need to do if hyung\u2019s the one becoming famous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhotos of celebrities\u2019 families pop up on the internet too! Should I get double-eyelid surgery?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother-in-law! Should we set up another date with father-in-law and mother-in-law and the others? Joyoon appeared a lot so we should all go watch it together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s parents slowly came to their senses once their relatives began chatting excitedly.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s father slapped his knee as he shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Let\u2019s buy a hundred tickets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t show mother and father. They might faint from shock if they watch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I was also frightened when Joyoon threw that child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhuh, hyung really looked insane. You were scarier than the zombies.\u201d</p><br/><p>His family chattered on while holding him. The person in question, Nam Joyoon, was silent, yet the faces around him were dyed red in excitement. Nam Joyoon\u2019s father\u2019s shoulders hopped up and down like a drunk\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo leaned against the door and watched.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s mother carefully approached him. Her gaze was filled with gratefulness before the movie began, but she now looked like she was looking at her benefactor. Blinking her still teary eyes, his mother said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgot to ask with all the commotion before, but you are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Jung Sunwoo. Please feel free to speak casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile hung on his cold face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then, are you Joyoon\u2019s manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, his female cousin joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunty, this oppa is Lee Songha\u2019s manager-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo replied while his gaze met Nam Joyoon\u2019s, who was surrounded by his family.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am hyung\u2019s manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>The commotion continued even as they went down the emergency exit. Nam Joyoon\u2019s family was already planning their fourth movie watching event. At this rate, they would hand out movie tickets like wedding invitations.</p><br/><p>Someone placed their hand on Jung Sunwoo\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>It was Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. For making this all happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a quiet voice, but Nam Joyoon\u2019s always plain face clearly looked moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you acting like it\u2019s all over? This is only the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo said while putting on his sunglasses again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get even crazier from now on. To the point where today\u2019s experience isn\u2019t even a preview. First, I\u2019m trying to work out a good contract for you. Ah, I am thinking about having you do an interview or appear on an entertainment show, but if there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like, then let me kno-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let me know. What I have to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you tell me to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo stopped in his steps.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You can\u2019t say that so lightly, hyung. You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll tell you to do in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I got you some weird entertainment program?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo\u2019s said as his lips curled into a crooked smile. It wasn\u2019t clear if he was joking or not.</p><br/><p>However, Nam Joyoon smiled faintly as he walked ahead of him. Then he joined his noisy family.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoon began walking again.</p><br/><p>A strange smile hung on his lips.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>-The unknown actor, Mr. Nam Joyoon, who appeared on Alive. Is he from your company, team leader?</p><br/><p>The voice on the other end seemed disappointed.</p><br/><p>-If you had such a good rookie, you should have let me know. Everyone\u2019s clamoring to find a fresh face since this face looks like that one. Team leader, did Mr. Nam Joyoon in talks with other projects for his next work?</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader calmly ended his phone call with the director. Then he threw his phone. His phone smashed into the wall with a loud crash before rolling on the floor. Waiting in the side, Chief Jo held his breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the third one today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the third call asking about Nam Joyoon today! If they are calling me, then the PR Team must be swamped with them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader swore as he slumped into his chair.</p><br/><p>Chief Jo watched his expression as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a passing breeze. You know how people overreact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause people are so loud, talking about Nam Joyoon this, Nam Joyoon that. They look at me like I\u2019m blind. I can\u2019t even go outside the office because it\u2019s so embarrassing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce Inho\u2019s movie is released, no one will doubt your eye. His project will undoubtedly be a success, but he\u2019s a natural when you see him acting on set.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader frowned slightly at the mention of Song Inho\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m the one who picked him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Yoon didn\u2019t seem happy because we pushed out the actor already confirmed for Inho\u2019s part at first, but now he can\u2019t help but acknowledge his skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make Inho a top star for sure. So much that Nam Joyoon can\u2019t even compare to him. You watch out for Inho too. Dowon became like that because he couldn\u2019t control his lower half, and Chaeyoung causes a fuss whenever she\u2019s bored. Jijoon used to be obedient before, but now he won\u2019t listen to a word I say. We need to keep Inho on the right path from the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader let out an unpleasant sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how\u2019s it going with Nam Joyoon\u2019s contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo and the Team 3 Leader seem to be discussing conditions in the director\u2019s office. It seems Jung Sunwoo considers Nam Joyoon as his actor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That bastard, is he doing is own work properly to be working on other things?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader said, raising his brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 Lee Songha\u2019s popularity is rising thanks to her drama and movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune? Lee Taehee\u2019s doing well since the drama OST became a hit. Their previous mini-album was a double jackpot so the Audio &amp; Recording Team wants her to write the title track for their next album. Im Seoyoung and LJ are appearing on shows. Although they are a hot topic, their ratings seem to be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how good his luck is, there\u2019s no way everyone under him is doing well. Investigate in detail. Check if there really aren\u2019t any problems!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader with an insidious look.</p><br/><p>Someone hastily knocked on his door and entered. It was Song Inho. Anyone would admire his looks after being carefully taken care of over the past few months. However, his previously youthful, clear eyes were now gloomy like a swamp.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, I think my schedule for tomorrow has changed sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe independent film schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told them to change it because Director Yoon wanted to move his schedule to tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s supposed to be a location shoot. It\u2019s a place that they had a hard time getting so if we can\u2019t shoot it-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told Chief Jo to adjust the independent film\u2019s schedule so you don\u2019t have to worry and just focus on tomorrow\u2019s shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey keep facing setbacks because of me, yet again-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSong Inho. This is why I told you not to do the independent film.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho sounded desperate. He looked at Chief Jo, asking for help, but Chief Jo simply shook his head as if saying the team leader\u2019s words were correct. The Team 2 Leader, who had clicked his tongue in displeasure, attempted to console him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it was to get you cast in Director Yoon\u2019s project? Can\u2019t you see which one is more important? If I didn\u2019t see potential in you, I wouldn\u2019t be here saying all this! How can I leave someone destined for higher heights be held back by something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader added in a resolute voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do as you\u2019re told. Then I\u2019ll give you a brilliant debut with you winning the rookie award!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon leisure walked down the hall with a thick scenario in their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, how about we show this scenario to Chief Jung?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t trust you, just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already showed him. We decided to talk after he reads it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon said while sticking out his belly.</p><br/><p>Moved, Seo Jijoon wrapped his arm around Chief Lee Bongjoon\u2019s round shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really. What would I have done if you weren\u2019t my manager? Without you, I\u2019m trash. You know that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just say that, mention me in your interviews.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cracking up, they arrived at the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office</p><br/><p>A frustrated shout erupted from the office. It was the Team 2 Leader. Chief Lee Bongjoon quickly took his hand off the knob and backed away. Seo Jijoon did the same. They exchanged glances, agreeing that now was not the time, and turned around.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the door burst open, and Song Inho left with a stiff face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hello, sunbae. Chief Lee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho momentarily looked at Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon then bowed and left. His handsome figure seemed to falter for some reason. Chief Lee Bongjoon clicked his tongue in pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems they fought again. I wonder if they might push him over the edge at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMakes me think of the past. I might have been depressed without you back when I was a rookie. But it seems the team leader is more hysteric than usual. Is he experiencing menopause?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Chief Jung. There\u2019s a lot hanging on their battle. There are quite a few actors in the company who are interested in him since everything he works on is a success. It makes sense since a manager who gets you hits is the best for actors. The team leader must be annoyed by this as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon glanced at the shut door.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, this is the calm before the storm. I bet they\u2019ll properly duke it out soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe team leader and Chief Jung? No matter how great things are going for Chief Jung, will it even be a fight? Just look at the number of actors the team leader had brought on. Chief Jung can\u2019t compare to his influence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon rubbed his sharp chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I guess I should at least take Chief Jung\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I might have thought the same as you in the past\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon crossed his arms and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more I see Jung Sunwoo, the more I feel like he\u2019s not some pushover either.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Song Inho brought his phone to his ear again. It still continued to only ring.</p><br/><p>Placing his phone down, he continued to walk down the hallway. Each step seemed heavy like he had just got out of the water. After arriving in front of the door, he raised his hand. He hesitated for a moment before ringing the doorbell.</p><br/><p>Like his phone, there was no answer.</p><br/><p>Song Inho leaned against the wall and slumped down.</p><br/><p>Just then, the door creaked open.</p><br/><p>A man who had a towel over his wet hair as though he had just gotten out of a shower looked out. Song Inho jumped to his feet as soon as he saw him.

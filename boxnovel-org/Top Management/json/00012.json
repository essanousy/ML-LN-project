Most the comments were criticizing Lemon Girls and Yoolam, but I found a few about Next K-Star. Most were saying that it was good that the staff\u2019s reaction was quick.</p><br/><p>Luckily, there weren\u2019t many mean comments aimed at Neptune. Not many gave them any attention.</p><br/><p>Like they were going to wait and see since the producer said they had potential?</p><br/><p>If it was under normal circumstances, there would have been plenty of mean comments on how Neptune pushed out Lemon Girls for the spot, but the trouble Yoolam caused was so big that it seemed that the majority of the mean commenters were focused on her.</p><br/><p>When I searched for Neptune, I saw some articles with Neptune in their headlines.</p><br/><p>[Who is \u2018Neptune\u2019 who is replacing Lemon Girls on Next K-Star?] [Neptune joins [Next K-Star\u2019, who are they\u2026]When I clicked on the article, it was about their profiles, their failed album and their current activities related to their new single. There were even new pictures of the members. At the bottom, it said it was provided by W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>Looking at the comments, there were quite a few complimenting their appearance. As I was saving each one and reading it, I saw some unbelievable comments.</p><br/><p>-I guess they\u2019re there for their looks. Since it\u2019s a competition program, they\u2019ll probably just leave them at the bottom.</p><br/><p>-Huge advantage for the other teams. Kekekekeke</p><br/><p>There were tens of people agreeing with them. I was speechless.</p><br/><p>I logged on to reply, but a keyboard warrior had already entered the fray. It was under the nickname \u2018Neptune Mom\u2019 and when I examined other comments, the person had already replied to a huge number of them, mostly protecting and supporting Neptune. Although the person wasn\u2019t swearing, his fighting strength was at max level and the mean commenters were dropping off one by one.</p><br/><p>Was there already a fan of Neptune?</p><br/><p>While carefully reading these articles and comments, my sleepiness went away. Instead, I was flooded with feelings of excitement and delight. Hyunjo\u2019s words were correct. The feeling of watching a new group grow in popularity and be acknowledged\u2026 This really was addicting.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t like I took care of them myself. However, as I contributed to this incident, I definitely had the right to feel satisfied. Of course, of course.</p><br/><p>The subway stopped shortly. It was my stop. As I arrived at the company listening to Neptune\u2019s songs, I got a call. It was Hyunjo. It was 7:53 right now. Safe!</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-You on your way?</p><br/><p>This person, why is he constantly going back and forth between formal and casual speech? So inconsistent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am right at the door. What floor should I go to?\u201d</p><br/><p>-The management team is on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor. Come to meeting room B. Don\u2019t come empty handed, there\u2019s a coffee shop in front of the company so buy some coffee. Two hot cups of Americano\u2026</p><br/><p>I promptly pressed the record button.</p><br/><p>-One vanilla latte, one caf\u00e9 mocha with whipped cream\u2026 wait, Gunyoung, what did you want\u2026 one cappuccino and get whatever you want.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Did you remember it all?</p><br/><p>\u201cI recorded it.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Hey, good job.</p><br/><p>I never imagined I would hear a compliment for getting coffee.</p><br/><p>I went back outside. As soon as I crossed the street, I saw a 24-hour coffee shop. I placed the coffees in a box and held it with both hands.</p><br/><p>Although I wasn\u2019t worried about being late, I hurriedly returned to not let the coffees cool down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, crap, what floor was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I forgot.</p><br/><p>To call again after hearing that I did a good job was a bit\u2026 it just so happened there was a man already on the elevator so I quickly went on.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, what floor is management team 3 on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the fourth floor. Would you like me to press it for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was killer. Was he an employee?</p><br/><p>When I looked to the side, I was surprised. It was the movie star, Sung Dowon.</p><br/><p>He was the top actor representing 20-year-olds. Very tall with wide shoulders of a swimmer, even if he wore rags, he was blessed with a body that would make even the rags look good. His good looks couldn\u2019t even be covered by sunglasses.</p><br/><p>However, Sung Dowon wasn\u2019t an actor known just for his good looks. His acting skills were equally great. He even had an influence on box office sales.</p><br/><p>His drama was a big hit in China and his two recent movies even reached 10 million and 6 million viewers respectively, raising his value in the Chungmuro District daily.</p><br/><p>I remembered reading how W&amp;U lured him in with a huge payment and a chance to move onto Hollywood when he ended his previous contract, but I never thought I would see him so soon.</p><br/><p>Well, since this was fate, I should ask him for a handshake\u2026 as soon as I thought that, the scene in front of my eyes faded out.</p><br/><p>Was this the future?</p><br/><p>However, it was a bit different this time.</p><br/><p>Like a screen with a signal that kept dropping, my surroundings were hazy. What was this?</p><br/><p>Also, until now, the futures I had seen took place during an interview with Director Park and Reporter Song, but I was sitting in front of a man in an unfamiliar office. It looked like there were other people around us, but it was too hazy to make them out and I could only just barely make out the face of the man in front of me.</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>It was Sung Dowon. It was Sung Dowon smiling without his sunglasses on. He didn\u2019t look any older. It was the same face I saw just a few moments ago.</p><br/><p>Really, what was this?</p><br/><p>While I fell into a state of utter confusion I could hear Dowon\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my savior. If it wasn\u2019t for Mr. Sunwoo, I would have been caught in their trap and my life as an actor could have been over. And because of this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Saviour? Me? What was this trap now?</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that Mr. Sunwoo could become my manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at the fourth floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The same voice overlapped. As I woke up from my previous state, Dowon was pressing the open button on the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I exited the elevator in a dazed state.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you have a great day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hope you have a great day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elevator went up carrying Dowon. I was dumbly looking at the closed elevator doors.</p><br/><p>What was that just now?</p><br/><p>It was definitely different from the future I saw yesterday. The hazy surroundings and the time I experienced the future was short. Above all, it didn\u2019t seem like a distant future.</p><br/><p>When would this happen? There just weren\u2019t enough hints.</p><br/><p>He said I helped him? So, would there really be an incident in the future? Would there?</p><br/><p>For Sung Dowon to ask me to be his manager\u2026 If I could answer, I would have said okay right away.</p><br/><p>Although I did think about Neptune briefly and although I was starting to learn the pleasures and satisfaction of taking care of a new group, as expected, I still wanted to be an actor\u2019s manager. And it was even Sung Dowon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing over there? Hurry up.\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar voice brought me back to reality. Facing the elevator was meeting room B. The traitor\u2019s upper body was sticking out of the half-opened door as he gestured with his finger.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s leave the future that I am uncertain when will happen and focus on the present, the present.</p><br/><p>After checking that the coffees were fine, I hurriedly entered the meeting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello! I brought the coffee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the money for the coffee later.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Hyunjo has decided to speak casually. I told you to do it before.</p><br/><p>Besides Hyunjo and Gunyoung, there were two women and a man in the meeting room. As I was greeting everyone, I was startled when I saw Hyunjo\u2019s outfit. Jeans and a loose man-to-man t-shirt. It was the same clothes as yesterday.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me he didn\u2019t go home after the bar, but to the company?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis here is the new recruit, Jung Sunwoo and they are members of the PR team.\u201d</p><br/><p>I matched their faces to their names in my mind. The skinny woman with no makeup in her 30s was Team Leader Park of the PR team. And the pair below her seemed to be the same age as me.</p><br/><p>Although I failed to leave a good first impression yesterday, today I will!</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Jung Sunwoo. Pleased to meet you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoffee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk after drinking some coffee. I think I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lost to coffee.</p><br/><p>I took my share of the coffee and crammed into an empty seat.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I had some expectations for my first meeting. I imagined a scene of men in suits and women in white blouses and H line skirts sitting with their legs crossed seriously discussing matters.</p><br/><p>When they got tired, they would relax with a cup of coffee\u2026 Well, although it wasn\u2019t to that point, I did expect something similar.</p><br/><p>Hahaha. Useless expectations.</p><br/><p>This place looked more like PC bang[1] than a meeting room. There were laptops and paper spread all over the table and the people looked like game addicts drinking coffee after just finishing an all-nighter gaming session.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park looked at me and asked abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the Lucky Charm of Management Team 3? The one who grabbed a big fish on his first day. Congrats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess there really is something like beginner\u2019s luck, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did he get such a fortunate encounter? Did he save a nation in his past life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did what we couldn\u2019t do in 2 years in a day\u2026 what a cruel world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The trio of the PR Team took me as an appetizer as they conversed about me.</p><br/><p>The traitor looked uninterested and Hyunjo was busy on his phone. I didn\u2019t know who kept trying to contact him, but his phone was vibrating nonstop.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park glanced at Hyunjo\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at how busy Chief\u2019s phone is ringing, it seems like Neptune will be busy from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks to be that way. It seems like work will finally be enjoyable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to row when the tide comes in. Toss us anything that looks article-worthy about Neptune. Both of you new recruits as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what she was going to do, but I answered anyways. Fortunately, Team Leader Park explained right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust record anything that seems like it would get a decent reaction. The girls playing with each other, what they are eating, even them tripping while walking. It doesn\u2019t matter if we end up using them or not, the more we have the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>She explained that if there were decent pictures, they would upload them on Neptune\u2019s official social media accounts and use them for articles and they would keep funny stories of their daily life for talk shows or interviews.</p><br/><p>They said it was better to start gathering them now, than using boring stories that would get edited out or making them up on the fly later on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Seoyoung thought Producer Joontae was a fan and wanted to give him her autograph. Stuff like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? How did you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones who knew that were Seoyoung, Producer Joontae and myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the PR team.\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled cunningly.</p><hr/><br/><p>[1] PC bang is a Korean LAN gaming center, where people pay to play games on computers.

However, she got up in 2 seconds and continued. There were people who disdained her, saying she was participating in their team activities half-heartedly even thought she was a rookie, but when looking at this, she doesn\u2019t look like someone who would do that.</p><br/><p>-Oh my god. It hurts just watching.</p><br/><p>-If it looks like this on screen, then it must have a huge downpour.</p><br/><p>-I read the comments of the person who took the fan cam, and it said that they only did the rehearsal and didn\u2019t even get to appear on the broadcast due to the weather. So sad. T^T</p><br/><p>-I heard from somewhere that this was the day of the first Next K-Star recording. There were tons of people who were bashing her after watching the first broadcast, saying her expression looked sour or that she didn\u2019t look like she worked hard, but to be honest, there\u2019s no way your condition wouldn\u2019t be good if you went to a recording after that.</p><br/><p>-But when I keep replaying the video, she glances at her ankle at around 2:34 after she gets up. Maybe she got a sprain?</p><br/><p>-Huh? You\u2019re right.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m honestly shocked by all the controversies about her attitude and personality. My friend saw Lee Songha in front of W&amp;U before, and she said she was very friendly and let her take pictures and stuff.</p><br/><p>-You have the photo?</p><br/><p>-She does, but she says she can\u2019t upload it online since her manager took the picture with his feet<sup>{1}</sup>.</p><br/><p>The video of Lee Songha falling was quietly spreading with social media and community sites at its core.</p><br/><p>It was different from before. It didn\u2019t suddenly appear on the real-time search rankings or was plastered on articles. However, it wasn\u2019t like the bait wasn\u2019t effective either. Instead, it was surprisingly positive.</p><br/><p>There were more people looking positively at Lee Songha herself without the label of \u2018the hot topic headliner\u2019 or \u2018the controversy headliner\u2019.</p><br/><p>And this turned into a reaction towards Neptune.</p><br/><p>-Even if Neptune\u2019s performances were good, I didn\u2019t feel like fangirling over them because of the gossip behind Lee Songha, but the fan cam slayed me. After watching this, I want to support them so much.</p><br/><p>-Same, I agree. Ah, it\u2019s so hard to fangirl over rookie idols since they don\u2019t have any good material. T^T</p><br/><p>-I\u2019ve been looking since I was interested as well, but there\u2019s nothing. W&amp;U, go work! What are you doing by not putting them in public network broadcasts?!</p><br/><p>-Let\u2019s use this momentum to promote Neptune! You can\u2019t leave once you join.</p><br/><p>There were more people talking about Neptune, and there were people who weren\u2019t satisfied with the material they found and were making their own. The number of people visiting Neptune\u2019s official homepage, which was managed by the PR team, and their fan caf\u00e9<sup>{2}</sup> increased drastically in one day.</p><br/><p>Since the homepage, whose comment section had been bare as an empty house, kept receiving comments, it finally felt worthwhile monitoring them. The Neptune girls opened their official homepage or fan caf\u00e9 on their phones whenever they had the opportunity, especially Im Seoyoung, who I suspected was addicted to it.</p><br/><p>Of course, the people making malicious comments about Lee Songha didn\u2019t disappear. However, instead of people replying to them in the passing, there were now fans who diligently rebutted them.</p><br/><p>The change was slow yet definitely occurring.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresents. From your fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Our fans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the other girls\u2019 faces were dazed, Im Seoyoung\u2019s was especially surprised. Her already large eyes widened even further. It seemed like her eyes would pop out if someone smacked the back of her head.</p><br/><p>I placed the paper bags, of which I had two in each hand, in the living room of their residence.</p><br/><p>They were presents sent to Neptune members. The company employee who gathered the presents and handed them to me laughed, saying that it was very little compared to Blackout, but it was more important that they received presents rather than how many.</p><br/><p>This was proof they gained true fans.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, are you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said so jokingly, Im Seoyoung nervously glanced between me and the paper bags.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, you can\u2019t joke about things like this. Although oppa is heartless, I trust that you aren\u2019t mean enough to joke about something as important as thi-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking this back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I picked up the paper bags, Im Seoyoung slid on the living room floor and clung onto me. I grinned and told the other girls to come closer as well. Although they didn\u2019t make such a big deal out of this like Im Seoyoung, they all approached with expectant eyes.</p><br/><p>I checked the contents of the paper bag and handed them out to the girls. Im Seoyoung received two bags while Lee Taehee and LJ each received one. I heard that there were weird people who sent garbage as presents so checked each one, but the presents sent to Im Seoyoung were of the small, cute character merchandise and doll variety.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung loved her presents with teary eyes that seemed to she might cry any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? I wonder who sent it. Euaah\u2026 I received four dolls! How did they know I like dolls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA photo was uploaded on our official social media, dummy. The one where you were bawling like someone who\u2019s lost their country while hugging a doll.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said apathetically. Im Seoyoung, who had been enjoying looking at the dolls, instantly glared at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIts leg ripped because you punched it, you gangster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did it because I was pissed at Son Chaeyoung! And I fixed it later!\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true. LJ sewed the ripped area together. It was quite well done. I was quite surprised by her unexpected talent. That was also uploaded on their social media, and maybe it was because of it, but LJ received a sewing box among her presents.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee\u2019s presents were cough drops and red ginseng concentrate, which was effective against fatigue. Perhaps it was because she occasionally would thump her lower back or act lethargic, but it seemed she had a granny image, even though she was only 22.</p><br/><p>After drinking a pack of red ginseng extract, Lee Taehee nodded her head. It seemed she liked it. I felt this when she was drinking the wild ginseng wine by herself, but her tastes were quite unusual.</p><br/><p>I took some pictures of the girls holding their presents as proof.</p><br/><p>Then I turned my head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who had been looking vacantly for a while, tilted her head and looked behind me. After confirming there wasn\u2019t anything there, she looked at my thin coat pocket and empty hands before sitting down on the rug and flipping through the script. Although it looked like she was fine, her shoulders were slightly slumped.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, come and eat this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee handed her a cough drop. Im Seoyoung and LJ, both aware that only Lee Songha didn\u2019t receive anything, hid their excited expressions. Im Seoyoung looked at me and mouthed, \u2018Is there really nothing?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a little, why is he taking so-\u201c</p><br/><p>Just as I looked at the front door, the door burst open.</p><br/><p>The traitor entered with quick steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, they fell in the elevator, and I had to pick them back up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 gazes were fixed on the dolly the traitor had dragged in. There was a box and two paper bags on top of it. The box was so big I couldn\u2019t wrap my arms around it.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s eyes shined as she came closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I said that, Lee Songha opened the box. Then she opened her mouth with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>The inside was filled with things to eat. From a large bag of chips to a small chocolate bar, the large box was filled with snacks. On a bag, there was a sincere post-it, telling her to eat this and cheer up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou remember Seo Jijoon\u2019s fans, right? The people you saw on your first drama shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey sent this to cheer you on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because they saw her eating the snacks piled up on her plate, but the present was optimized for her. Because those fans mentioned that Lee Songha liked eating after the drama shoot, her other presents were centered around food as well.</p><br/><p>There were even hand-written letters.</p><br/><p>The majority of them were encouraging her, telling her to cheer up even though the current situation wasn\u2019t good, to ignore the hate comments, and that they were awaiting her drama.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha sat down with her presents and went back and forth between holding snacks and letters.</p><br/><p>Although she didn\u2019t really show it, she was happy. She was very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, you must be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you can set up a convenience store in your room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s even something that was handmade! How are you going to eat something so precious?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked at the four of them chatting together, I unconsciously smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they received presents, I finally feel that they\u2019ve become more well-known.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor nodded as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf their fandom becomes more concrete, and Next K-Star, Songha\u2019s drama, and their next album do well one after each other\u2026 They should be able to consolidate their footing by next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned my head and looked at the traitor from the side.</p><br/><p>His face gave off a nice impression, and his amiable eyes were looking at Neptune. He suddenly turned towards me. Our eyes met. Although his gaze wasn\u2019t any different from just now, my fingers reflexively stiffened.</p><br/><p>He smiled brightly as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to make it happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>The drama shoots were on a tight schedule.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t care about night or day, and of course, there was no start or end time for work. Depending on the situation, we had times where we arrived at night but had to wait until morning. Our meal times were erratic, and our sleeping schedule was more so.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Lee Songha and I had the van we could rest in, but the staff slept anywhere they could sit their butts down. It was to the point where there would always be someone curled up sleeping on the emergency exit stairs during a shoot.</p><br/><p>I was seriously curious whether there had been anyone who died of exhaustion during filming.</p><br/><p>Luckily, since there wasn\u2019t film shoot today due to a Next K-Star recording, I could avoid sleeping in the van. Still, I had to sleep in the night duty room at the company.</p><br/><p>With a toothbrush in my mouth, I blankly stared at the whiteboard.</p><br/><p>At first, Neptune\u2019s name was as rare as a blue moon, but now that their name was posted at least two or three times a week, my heart felt plentiful even though I currently looked like I was homeless. Although the majority of them were Lee Songha\u2019s drama schedules, I expected there to be more team schedules or other girls\u2019 personal schedules in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who had also slept in the night duty room, yawned as he approached. I was surprised when I looked at his face. He was someone who seemed to have dark circles tattooed to his face, but his entire face was the color of dark circles these days.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief. I\u2019m asking this because I\u2019m really curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou divided the work you had before with Gunyoung and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I divided it a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why does it seem like your work hasn\u2019t decreased?\u201d</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t recruits supposed to think, \u2018Ah, I need to work hard to be like them,\u2019 when they saw their superiors? But why did I want to slump onto the floor when I thought that I might look like Kim Hyunjo in a few years?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you know how, when you make money, there\u2019s always something you need to spend it on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you have more time, you have more things to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo smiled faintly and changed the subject as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut when is your next drama shoot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight after the recording. We have to standby until 2 a.m.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, they\u2019re really pushing you hard. Why are they filming that drama every day? You guys have quite a bit of the script complete and started filming early even compared to public networks. But how are you guys busier than Mermaid out of Water?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Shin is a perfectionist.\u201d</p><br/><p>First, he was very picky about the continuity of shots. It wasn\u2019t simply displaying the positions of cameras and the size of cuts, but even their emotions and details about how it would be edited filled the pages of the book detailing them.</p><br/><p>He even took the trouble to shoot each scene in various ways.</p><br/><p>However, there was no one who was dissatisfied with this as they believed the degree of polish would be equally high. Also, if they filmed a lot beforehand, they wouldn\u2019t be as pressed for time once they started broadcasting.</p><br/><p>Instead of hurriedly filming it while broadcasting, it was better to be busier now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still two weeks before the release of Cat Guardian Ghost, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were 2 weeks until the drama premiered.</p><br/><p>The interest in Cat Guardian Ghost hadn\u2019t diminished yet. To be precise, we were managing it so that it wouldn\u2019t drop.</p><br/><p>We periodically released short behind-the-scenes videos, teasers, and pictures taken during the film shoot, and whenever it seemed like Lee Songha\u2019s controversy would die down, it surged once again. This was because Producer Go Joontae from Next K-Star was using Lee Songha as kindling for viewership ratings.</p><br/><p>That damn bastard.</p><br/><p>Next K-Star had recently hit its highest viewership rating at 7%. As it kept rising, Producer Go Joontae was becoming too big for his shoes.</p><br/><p>It was great that Neptune\u2019s popularity would rise alongside the rising viewership ratings, but the problem was he was burning Lee Songha. It was because it was Lee Songha that she was able to endure this long, if it was someone else with a weaker mentality than her, they would have lost it already.</p><br/><p>He would edit the episodes in that way yet speak nonsense about how he gave her more screen time or whatever with a deceitful smile. It was to the point I wanted to rip open his mouth.</p><br/><p>I would only feel refreshed if I threw shit at his face.</p><br/><p>Still, since Neptune\u2019s fans were bashing Producer Go Joontae into pulp online, I was calming my heart with that. If I didn\u2019t even have that as comfort, I really might have been unable to control my temper.</p><br/><p>Just as I bit down on my toothbrush, becoming irritated simply thinking about it, the traitor approached me from behind. It seemed he had washed his face just now as water dripped from his bangs. When I turned around, I suddenly became shocked.</p><br/><p>Although Kim Hyunjo was also serious, he was worse.</p><br/><p>His face showed that he was so exhausted he could die.</p><br/><p>Even though I knew that he was helping Kim Hyunjo prepare for Neptune\u2019s next album while I was busy with the drama, I thought that he would at least be better off than me. But what\u2019s this? His face seemed to have suffered more hardship than me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be outside having a smoke.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice croaked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to my reply, he disappeared, off to find somewhere to have a smoke.</p><br/><p>While looking at his receding figure, I asked Kim Hyunjo,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the album preparations are tough too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, he\u2019s been busy with something else these days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who was in the middle of a yawn, shut his mouth as if he said something he shouldn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething he\u2019s busy with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I asked right away, Kim Hyunjo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something like that. In my eyes, he\u2019s just wasting his time, but it still counts as experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked him a few more times, he adamantly said it wasn\u2019t something he should say now as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>Something he was busy with\u2026</p><br/><p>Just what was it?</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Left it as it was since the meaning is pretty straightforward and I like it.

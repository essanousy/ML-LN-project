His words were cut off by a sigh. He rubbed his temples as he mumbled, \u2018Oh, what a headache.\u2019 The way he looked at me changed. It was as though I was a pain in the neck instead of a lucky charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo. You need to calm down. I think you just said that without thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried to reason with me. His attitude was different from his normally not-so-serious self.</p><br/><p>I glanced next to me. The one who needed to calm down seemed to be someone else. The Team 2 Leader\u2019s face was dark. He glared at me with a menacing look. If he could kill with his gaze, my body would have been torn off limb by limb and scattered on the carpet.</p><br/><p>The director said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand how you feel. I get it, but if you\u2019re going to stir trouble, it should be within your capabilities. How do you plan on dealing with the aftermath if you take them with you? Are you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was shockingly calm right now.</p><br/><p>I thought I would have trouble breathing or my hands would be shaking once I said those words, but it came out so nonchalantly as if I was deciding what I was going to eat for dinner. My body and mind moved naturally like a stream.</p><br/><p>Examining my reaction, the director shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s act like that didn\u2019t happen. Let\u2019s do that, CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, personally check with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than agreeing with him, CEO Baek Hansung replied with an order.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Check?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeo Jijoon and Im Joowon\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taken aback, the director\u2019s butt jolted. I also flinched.</p><br/><p>I had thought that they wouldn\u2019t outright reject the idea if Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon revealed their intentions to join my team since companies tended to cater to actors on their level. However, I didn\u2019t think it would proceed so quickly.</p><br/><p>I had thought he would ask something more from me. His actions made me wonder if the Team 2 Leader had fallen out of CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s favor.</p><br/><p>I gave CEO Baek Hansung a doubtful look. Our eyes met. Like the director, he also looked at me differently. On one hand, it looked like he was watching an amateur\u2019s cute actions, but on the other hand, it looked like he was pleased.</p><br/><p>Either way, it seemed like he had hoped I would act like this.</p><br/><p>He looked at me and Song Inho before gesturing with his chin,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two should step out. I think the Team 2 Leader and I need to have a talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader was silent. His gaze simply stabbed at my back.</p><br/><p>I brushed my seat and got up. After saying goodbye, I brought Song Inho out of the CEO\u2019s office. I was walking while guessing at what kind of conversation would take place when I didn\u2019t hear any footsteps following me. I turned around, and Song Inho wasn\u2019t unable to regain his senses like he was being washed down a current. His no longer tearful face looked dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, is this all? Is it fine like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make it fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly raised my shoulders when the CEO\u2019s office burst open. The Team 2 Leader rushed at me like a mad boar. Just as I thought he was going to hit me, I was hit with his fist. Another fist made its way towards me as I faltered.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam 2 Leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t plan on getting hit twice without making a sound. I quickly pulled my head back. The Team 2 Leader\u2019s fist narrowly brushed passed the bridge of my nose. Song Inho and the director rushed over when I grabbed his arm. Then they grabbed the Team 2 Leader\u2019s shoulders and pulled him off me.</p><br/><p>I pressed my aching cheek and swallowed. There was a disgusting taste in my mouth. Maybe something ripped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, are you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader stopped Song Inho, who was coming over.</p><br/><p>\u201cSong Inho! What\u2019s your problem? What did I not do for you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there was something you didn\u2019t like, you should have said so. What are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho\u2019s face distorted miserably. The Team 2 Leader continued to shout,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll let you or that bastard off after suffering like this? I told you that this industry was small. Do you think good rumors will spread about a guy who abandons his benefactor as soon as he makes it big? Worthless personal\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rumors should be that the actors were moved during an internal restructuring.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while taking a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the rising star of W&amp;U. Weird rumors won\u2019t be good for the company either. It\u2019ll make things difficult for the PR Team. Also, even if he changes teams, he\u2019s still part of the W&amp;U family. I don\u2019t think you should say things like not letting him off no matter how angry you are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Threats had to be made by the right person in the right place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, wouldn\u2019t that be best for you as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was just Inho, maybe there would have been rumors about his personality or something, but if three move teams, wouldn\u2019t it look like you are the problem? This industry is a small place. You would lose face if some weird rumors spread.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s mood grew more dangerous. The director, who gestured to me to act moderately from the back, eventually facepalmed. He steadfastly held onto the Team 2 Leader\u2019s shoulders as though he was worried punches would fly again.</p><br/><p>Huffing, the Team 2 Leader glared at Song Inho.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he persuaded you, but don\u2019t think\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI begged him to take me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho said in a subdued voice. The Team 2 Leader flinched.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy problem? I told you countless times, yet how can you not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho let out a frustrated sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t follow your methods. I\u2019m suffocating. Like you said, I\u2019m scared that rumors about how ungrateful I am will spread. However, if I stay with you, I feel like I will come to hate acting. That scares me more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he spoke, the more heavily the Team 2 Leader huffed. He looked like he didn\u2019t know what to do with all the shame, betrayal, and rage he felt. The director clicked his tongue and signaled me with his eyes. I took Song Inho and got in the elevator.</p><br/><p>As soon as the doors began to close, Song Inho collapsed against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be asking you that, hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell.\u201d</p><br/><p>I saw the Team 2 Leader between the closing doors. He was glaring at me without taking a single step. I stared back at him. His face distorted even more. Soon, the elevator began to move. Rather than the Team 2 Leader\u2019s face, the shiny elevator doors reflected my face.</p><br/><p>My face looked refreshed like I had been reborn.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Song Inho threw away all his grief after a drink. He was crawling around my living room when I grabbed him and flopped him down on my bed. I struggled a lot because he wouldn\u2019t let go of my ankle. The world had become quiet by the time I was able to wrap him up in my blanket.</p><br/><p>I emptied the remaining contents of the bottle. My mind was still sober even though I poured down liquor like it was water.</p><br/><p>Only my heart seemed to beat more loudly.</p><br/><p>I looked out my window, which reflected the streetlights and neon signs outside, before calling someone.</p><br/><p>-Who is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, I had forgotten I even had a second son. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since you last called?</p><br/><p>Her voice hid her sadness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas it been a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>-A while? It\u2019s been harder to hear your voice than when you went to mandatory military service. Your father lets you off, saying that no news is good news and that it\u2019s good that you\u2019re busy, but this is excessive. You\u2019re obviously busy during the week. Busy on weekends and holidays. Are you the only one that\u2019s this busy?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe all are. Sorry, I\u2019ll try my best to come down for Thanksgiving.\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>I said while checking my calendar. Would I be able to take a day or two off?</p><br/><p>-How are you? Are you stressed at work?</p><br/><p>Hmm, I did clear away a man who was stressing me out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Ah right, I\u2019ve been promoted.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Promoted? To what?</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mom\u2019s dazed voice went up a pitch. Chewing on octopus tentacles, I framed the events leading up to my promotion in a good way. My mom listened for a good while before she said in a serious voice.</p><br/><p>-Okay, I\u2019ll keep this to myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if others know. This isn\u2019t a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Really? I\u2019ve become used to watching what I say after you appeared on TV.</p><br/><p>My mom laughed awkwardly before adding.</p><br/><p>-Though I am happy that you\u2019re appearing on TV because you\u2019re successful and being promoted for doing a good job, do most people get promoted this quickly? The higher up you are, the more responsibilities you take on. I\u2019m worried.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have accepted if I didn\u2019t think I could handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>-If things are tough, talk to your brother. If it\u2019s still not resolved, then come down.</p><br/><p>My mom, who was advising me, suddenly laughed.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019ll pass you the phone!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Your father\u2019s pestering me, knowing that I\u2019m about to hang up.</p><br/><p>I unconsciously smiled. After talking with my father, I decided to call my brother. I chatted with the quadruplets for an hour on speakerphone. I had thought that no other life was as dynamic as mine, but the quadruplets didn\u2019t lose out.</p><br/><p>After them, I called Neptune, then Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon as well as Im Joowon and Chief Sung. I think I heard that I was crazy at least fifty times while explaining what happened today. In fact, one of them even messaged me saying that.</p><br/><p>I laid down on my sofa early in the morning. Then I flipped through the scenario I had started reading the night before. My mind filled up as I thought about Song Inho, Seo Jijoon, and Im Joowon\u2019s roles on top of Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>While I was at it, I brought out all the scenarios, drama proposals, and scripts. I cleared away the liquor bottles and side dishes from the living room table and spread out the actors\u2019 photos and posters. Then I looked at each of them.</p><br/><p>It was a sleepless yet satisfying night.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I arrived back in Seoul after a three-day business trip to China. As soon as I left the airport, I was met with hot, stuffy air. It seemed the heat wave had arrived because my back became soaked even though I wore a t-shirt. Even the people walking on the streets looked somewhat withered.</p><br/><p>My thirst burned my throat by the time I arrived at the company. I should buy a drink from a vending machine. No, an ice dispenser would be better. I got out the elevator thinking this and saw the lounge crawling with people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, hello, Team Leader Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood was uneasy.</p><br/><p>The way they were whispering to each other before going silent as soon as I got off the elevator. The way they staggered and nervously greeted me. Above all, the people who were calling me \u2018Team Leader Jung\u2019 were Team 2 chiefs who had recently disregarded me.</p><br/><p>Had the incident with the Team 2 Leader surfaced?</p><br/><p>I was looking around for someone to ask when the Team 3 Leader called me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Let\u2019s meet as soon as you arrive at work.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already here. I\u2019m in the lounge right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo popped out of the office immediately after I said that. Then they each grabbed my arm and dragged me into an empty meeting room. Other employee\u2019s gazes followed me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the mood? Is it because of the incident with the Team 2 Leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no answer. Instead, I looked at the two sitting in their seats. They looked baffled. As they were well aware of what happened between me and the Team 2 Leader, they shouldn\u2019t be this agitated because of that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 2 Leader handed in his resignation letter this weekend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Resignation letter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo nodded.</p><br/><p>I recalled the Team 2 Leader\u2019s face, which I had last seen in front of the CEO\u2019s office. I had thought he would be up to something, but a resignation letter? He just up and left the company? What did he discuss with CEO Baek Hansung that day?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a threat or anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the same thing when I first heard it too, but it\u2019s not. He received investments from China and is apparently planning on becoming independent. He said he had already discussed with his \u2018children\u2019, so he would take those whose contracts were almost up with him. Even excluding top stars like Son Chaeyoung and Jijoon, there are quite a few actors he had brought in.\u201d<sup>{2}</sup></p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. They made up the core of W&amp;U\u2019s lineup of actors.</p><br/><p>Actors like Song Inho and Seo Jijoon, who didn\u2019t align with the Team 2 Leader\u2019s methods, were a minority. The majority of actors whom the Team 2 Leader brought in from the free agency market approved of the Team 2 Leader\u2019s methods and skills. Like Son Chaeyoung in the past.</p><br/><p>He was the type who seemed sensitive to betrayal after being stabbed in the back like that.</p><br/><p>He said that he would turn his back on CEO Baek Hansung and take the actors who followed him with him?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Did he actually leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said, astonished, as though even he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader, who was quietly sitting there with his arms crossed, added,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe left alone. I don\u2019t know if talks didn\u2019t go well or something didn\u2019t go as planned at the end, but the actors who were supposed to leave with the Team 2 Leader remained. That\u2019s why the Team 2 Leader barged into the CEO\u2019s office not long ago and caused a huge commotion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo asked the Team 3 Leader,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he\u2019s received investments, without any trustworthy actors, won\u2019t he just waste away? Rumors will spread that he left the company on bad terms. Even if the CEO doesn\u2019t do anything, others will be cautious. Do you think actors will sign with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably done trying to make a place for himself in the country. If he goes to China though, he\u2019ll probably at least make a living.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader scratched his disheveled hair. He checked the firmly shut door before leaning towards me. Then he asked in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019ve also been offered investments from China, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the CEO know that too?\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> FYI, Korean Thanksgiving is in September</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> Remember, the Team 2 Leader treats actors like they are his own.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-193\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 193\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-195\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 195\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201502\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

What did you say I said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019Mark my words, W&amp;U will never help Mr. Joyoon regarding this matter\u2019 is what you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>His cheeks trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was curious what you meant by that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat meaning?! It just came-! It has nothing to do with W&amp;U.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he said that, he was too flustered to control his facial expressions. The fact that he said that it had nothing to do with W&amp;U sounded like it very much had something to do with it.</p><br/><p>What was it? What did he know for him to guarantee that Nam Joyoon would never be supported by W&amp;U?</p><br/><p>Someone at W&amp;U who met Nam Joyoon. And had a bad impression of him.</p><br/><p>There was only one person who came to mind.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see\u2026</p><br/><p>If he knew that an actor he rejected, especially one introduced by me, who he hated, obtained a significant role in a movie, then he might be bothered by that since it would mean his judgment was off.</p><br/><p>I bent my waist and whispered into Director Park\u2019s ear,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid our Team 2 Leader say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park flinched in surprise. His eyes trembled rapidly.</p><br/><p>His reaction was no different from a confession.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know him, right? The incident this time-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a movie director, of course, I know all the team leaders at W&amp;U!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park cut me off and waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems there\u2019s a huge misunderstanding, but what I meant was whether W&amp;U would look after Nam Joyoon when he has nothing to do with them and they have so many people to take care of! No, rather than talking about this, le-let\u2019s settle the contract first\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing as he changed the subject, it seemed like he would spill easily.</p><br/><p>Well, obviously, he would be more scared of a team leader than a chief like me.</p><br/><p>Like they say, it\u2019s a small world.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought about how I could get him to open his mouth while silently staring at his face.</p><br/><p>Ask? Persuade? These didn\u2019t seem like they would work.</p><br/><p>Threaten?</p><br/><p>Although I couldn\u2019t say for sure, it was worth trying. The timing just happened to be right as well.</p><br/><p>I suddenly recalled how I threated Teacher Shim Kyungtaek. It surprisingly wasn\u2019t a big deal. And threatening the Punchline member afterward was even easier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe-\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to speak, my phone in my hand vibrated. I glanced down and stopped once I checked the screen.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>That moment, it felt like something creaked to a halt. Then a breeze flowed through my dark, stuffy mind. I was looking at my screen when someone clung to my other arm. Director Park\u2019s voice struck my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I really kneel? Huh? Just say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it, Director Park! Why are you putting them in such a tough spot!\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk grabbed Director Park\u2019s shoulder with his pan-sized hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you bothering me when things are going well?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018things are going well\u2019?! Mr. Nam Joyoon is in talks with another project!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can adjust for that! Mr. Joyoon, you\u2019re going to continue with the movie, right? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park now clung to Nam Joyoon\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>His face was cloudy, seemingly worried about the film crew and cast\u2019s livelihood, yet he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was resolute.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Joyoon! This isn\u2019t a problem where you can say stuff like that so easily! Mr. Joyoon, are you going to abandon the film crew and cast, who were your family until this very morning, just because you have another opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park shook CEO Kim Pansuk\u2019s arm to the side and asked again, but Nam Joyoon shook his head.</p><br/><p>Seeing him like this, I let out a short sigh.</p><br/><p>I cleared my complicated mind and did what I had to.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to look at me with eyes full of expectation.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike you said, Mr. Nam Joyoon is still an unknown rookie. I think juggling two overlapping schedules will be difficult for him. Then I hope your project is a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park\u2019s face soured as he looked at me.</p><br/><p>What sort of expression was I making right now?</p><br/><p>I lightly bowed and turned my back with no regrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn bastards! If there\u2019s a problem with investments, it\u2019s all your fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Park! You\u2019re really! Mr. Sunwoo, please go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Held back by the Pan Production employees, Director Park continued to curse,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see how successful you get! I\u2019ll be watching you!\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll be successful. Without a doubt.</p><br/><p>I repeated in my mind as I shut the door.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Long fingers tapped the sofa armrest.</p><br/><p>Soon, CEO Baek Hansung turned his gaze away from the synopsis.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe project looks good. Let\u2019s go with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Then we\u2019ll proceed with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiting Team 2 Leader quickly replied.</p><br/><p>Although his business was finished, he acted like he was still drinking his half-full cup of black tea as he examined the CEO\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>While the Team 2 Leader was looking for an opportunity to speak, the director, who was looking at his tablet across from him, laughed as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that our Lucky Charm is always popping up in the entertainment section? I can\u2019t tell who\u2019s the celebrity anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s been brought up, about Jung Sunwoo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader picked up the conversation and stealthily joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know that he brought an actor over while finalizing the SBE film shooting schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 3 Leader mentioned it a while ago. Apparently, he\u2019s someone our Lucky Charm has his eye on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s his actress\u2019s project, it was a company matter. Isn\u2019t it a problem if he brings someone not affiliated with us to a place like that? This sort of behavior is unthinkable in my team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe personally made clear that it had nothing to do with W&amp;U. It\u2019s cute that he\u2019s so determined.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCute? Either way, the fact that he cannot distinguish between private and personal matters still stands.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader said.</p><br/><p>Leisurely setting his teacup down, the director said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so fixated on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m worried. I said it from the beginning. If you let him be, he\u2019s definitely going to cause a huge problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay that when he actually does.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to hide dislike aversion any longer, the Team 2 Leader was about to get up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was he?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung casually asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe actor Jung Sunwoo brought. I heard you personally interviewed him. How was he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 Nam Joyoon is his name.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader said, butt mid-air. He cleared his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis acting isn\u2019t bad since he did independent films for a long time, but that\u2019s it. He doesn\u2019t have that special aura of an actor. He\u2019s not an actor we should keep with an exclusive contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? There wasn\u2019t any other reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are tons of unknown actors who are as good at acting but are younger, better looking and have more potential than him. Even the new rookies we signed on this time are much better than him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Confident, the Team 2 Leader added,</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a great eye for actors. Do you not trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the great eye which said Park Dojin was someone of great character?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector! Why are you bringing that up again? He was fine when I saw him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director smiled brightly as he nodded.</p><br/><p>Face now red, the Team 2 Leader looked at CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne saw something in an actor while the other didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung leisurely perched his chin on his hands as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder whose eye is the real deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cChief.\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around. Nam Joyoon was looking at me with a worried face.</p><br/><p>It seemed my expression didn\u2019t look so good. Nam Joyoon patted my shoulder awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just thinking about something. I\u2019m fine so no need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I not? You were caught up in my problem the entire day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this situation, your problem is my problem. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I considered if I should tell him that the Team 2 Leader may have played a role in the hardship he suffered but decided against it.</p><br/><p>There was no need to tell him more bad news on a day like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget the past and focus on this.\u201d</p><br/><p>I handed him a thick envelope.</p><br/><p>It was the scenario of Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s new movie.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s face alternated between complicated emotions. He accepted the envelope with both hands. He held the envelope so tightly that his veins bulged. He even looked determined.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s fixated gaze on the envelope rose to look at me.</p><br/><p>The edges of my lips curled upwards as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s show them how successful we become.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I will work like this is my last.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to die? Why would it be your last?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to confirm something.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I tilted my head, Nam Joyoon continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day you came over and proposed we work together, you said you wanted to confirm if you had a good eye for actors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I will work like this is my last. I do not want to disappoint you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meeting his resolute gaze, I smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to say this before, but I think you should stop calling me \u2018chief\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so polite, hyung.<sup>{1}</sup>\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s eyes widened,</p><br/><p>Then he smiled at me.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After dropping Nam Joyoon off, I returned to the company.</p><br/><p>I went up to the PR Team on the fifth floor with coffee when I suddenly took out my phone.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, I didn\u2019t contact Lee Songha after texting her that I was in a meeting because I was so busy. I pressed the name in the list of missed calls. After a message informing me that it was a roaming call, it began to ring.</p><br/><p>Was she busy?</p><br/><p>She always answered by the second ring, but this time, the call ended before she answered. It was the same the second time I tried.</p><br/><p>I wanted to hear her voice.</p><br/><p>I pressed my contacts thinking about calling Lee Kwanwoo or Lee Taehee when someone said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re the busiest person in the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader was walking over from the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? I\u2019m quite busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>I casually replied after putting my phone back in my pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what Director Park said, it seems you were quite busy too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Director Park?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tilted his head as he nonchalantly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would Director Park talk about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pretending?</p><br/><p>Still, I clearly saw it. The instant his eyes trembled.</p><br/><p>My lips became crooked. It felt like poison was spreading in my mind.</p><br/><p>Then I suddenly saw the future I had seen not too long ago.</p><br/><p>The scene where my future self looked at a picture of the Team 2 Leader and called him his \u2018team member\u2019.</p><br/><p>I had various thoughts after seeing that. How did I originally live for me to make a team with the Team 2 Leader? Maybe the \u2018team\u2019 he was referring to was a blacklist? Maybe I didn\u2019t have any unpleasant encounters with him, only seeing his good side?</p><br/><p>But another thought took root right now.</p><br/><p>Perhaps my future self was\u2026</p><br/><p>Someone who it wouldn\u2019t be strange to be in a team with the Team 2 Leader.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I suppressed the thought that swept my mind and entered the PR Team office.</p><br/><p>Whether my thoughts were complicated or not, I had a job to do right now.</p><br/><p>The office was noisy for some reason. The employees were chatting around a table. I approached Team Leader Park, who was tapping on her keyboard all by herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, team leader. I also brought coffee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. The entire day\u2019s hectic, but I\u2019ll be able to get through it with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park smiled while accepting the coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to prepare for the interview SBE wants. You should think of a few comments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, how the situation with Ace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s chaos. Let them throw all the face they\u2019ve built up until now. This is what happens when they say it\u2019s true without a single word from us. Did they think they could push around our PR Team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park said, puffing her chest.</p><br/><p>I laughed. When I turned my gaze, I discovered two unfamiliar faces in the middle of the group of employees. They were a good-looking man and woman. Looking at their faces, they were celebrities without a doubt, but I had never seen them at work.</p><br/><p>Who were they?</p><br/><p>I saw the woman first, and when I turned to look at the man, the world spun.</p><br/><p>There was so much static that it difficult to see properly, but I could clearly tell where I was.</p><br/><p>The jib camera moving above me, and the camera rolling on the rails. The lights were shining so brightly they hurt my eyes. The audience\u2019s cheers and applause pounded my ears. And a man accepted a flower bouquet on the stage.</p><br/><p>It was an awards ceremony.</p><br/><p>I was standing amongst the staff, looking up at the stage.</p><br/><p>The man hugging the bouquet said into the mic,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo a lacking actor like me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In tears, his voice cut off for a moment. The master of ceremony\u2019s quick action filled this gap with applause. Soon, after barely managing to contain his tears, the man said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much for giving such a huge award to a lacking actor like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park\u2019s voice brought my mind out of its slumber.</p><br/><p>The static was completely gone. I clearly saw the two people surrounded by the PR Team employees. The two were greeting everyone with bright smiles, but the man soon met my gaze.</p><br/><p>He suddenly stood up and approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems he\u2019s coming over to introduce himself. It\u2019s your first time seeing them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Who are they? They seem like actors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are. They are the new rookies the Team 2 Leader selected not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park tapped my back as she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think they\u2019ll do well?\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Up until now, Nam Joyoon had been using polite speech to Jung Sunwoo despite being older. Here, Jung Sunwoo is using \u2018hyung\u2019, a more casual way of addressing Nam Joyoon than Mr. Nam Joyoon.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-133\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 133\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-135\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 135\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201380\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

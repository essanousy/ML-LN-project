He wrote it after seeing Making Film\u2019s second episode and the clip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it. He wrote a positive review as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou monitored reactions already?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Seoyoung is updating me about the current situation every five minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t in her right mind.</p><br/><p>She had lost it when we collected the recordings yesterday, and after we posted the video clip and her name stayed at the top of the real-time search rankings, her symptoms, which made me suspect she might have ADHD, have been getting worse.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t stay put for a moment, so LJ asked me if she could just tie her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let her be excited. She was the main contributor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park said happily,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear about this too? That Neptune\u2019s fandom chose today to be a day of harmony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung did talk about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this. I spurted coffee while reading this.\u201d</p><br/><p>She handed me her tablet. I scanned it as I walked.</p><br/><p>From Neptune\u2019s official homepage to various personal fan pages, each one had posted the same main message as if they were raising a flag. They screenshotted the clip that was released this morning. It was a picture where the Neptune members were huddled together in the living room laughing.</p><br/><p>A caption was written above it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Day of harmony, Fans unite!\u2019</p><br/><p>I laughed the moment I saw it.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park said in a joyful voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they are collecting money to donate 1 ton of rice? They want to donate it every year in celebration of today. Songha\u2019s personal fans took the lead. It seems they ended up bowing down dispiritedly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been troublesome for a while, but it\u2019s been resolved in one go. They must have been frightened after seeing the clip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha\u2019s remark was quite strong. Tell me honestly, did you make her say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shrugged and opened the meeting room door.</p><br/><p>The room, which was bustling like a market, instantly stopped. People quickly got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, you\u2019ve come!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, chief!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the left side of the table were the PR Team employees, and on the right were management employees. Their faces were haggard, but their faces were beaming with triumph like they had just obtained a huge victory. The meeting room became noisy again once Team Leader Park and I sat down in our seats.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung\u2019s a big hit now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the type to pull fans in. Like they say, even lookers can\u2019t beat hardcore fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, fans of other idols have reacted very favorably.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male PR Team employee showed me a tablet displaying online reactions.</p><br/><p>-Who has seen Neptune\u2019s clip on the portal? The comment section is going crazy.</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s no joke. It instantly got 500,000 views and thousands of comments.</p><br/><p>-I thought a fight broke out or something, but it turns out that other fans have come out in full strength and are crying in the comments lol</p><br/><p>-I saw the hidden camera scene with Im Seoyoung when it aired, and I felt even sadder thinking about my favorite artist. I watched it with my mom, and she told me to never be a celebrity.</p><br/><p>-I watched it without any thought and ended up with tears and snot running down my face. I wondered if my favorite group had the same thoughts. I plan on fangirling over Neptune as my second. I wasn\u2019t interested in them besides Lee Songha, but they seem really nice.</p><br/><p>-I became obsessed with Im Seoyoung yesterday and I spent all night looking her up hahaha</p><br/><p>-Their chemistry with each other is amazing too. My image of them has risen.</p><br/><p>-Wasn\u2019t that clearly scripted? Also, I disliked seeing Im Seoyoung hugging a doll at her age. Is it just me?</p><br/><p>-Just you.</p><br/><p>-Did you not see her doll collection in her room? You need to respect her preferences.</p><br/><p>-Scripted? LMFAO you think it would be scripted with Im Seoyoung\u2019s acting skills? LOL</p><br/><p>There were a few people trying to start a ruckus here and there, but the majority had positive reactions. As someone said, Neptune\u2019s image had become much better. The biggest benefit was the popularity of the other members, who had been hidden under Lee Songha\u2019s shadow, had surged.</p><br/><p>The PR Team employees chatted,</p><br/><p>\u201cA Making Film production assistant laughed like a madman when he told me the ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, he\u2019ll laugh! At 11.8%, we increased by almost 3%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the hottest topic for two weeks now, so there are new viewers after getting hooked through IPTV, streaming and downloading services. I bet there\u2019ll be more people watching next week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor programs like this, it\u2019s common for there to be a hot online reaction but a subdued offline one. Yet, Making Film is hot on and offline. The ages of viewers range widely from the teens to the middle-aged. If we\u2019re lucky, the fandom will appeal to the masses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently IBC brought up extending the broadcast by another week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProduct placements and commercials must be lined up right now, of course, they don\u2019t want to stop with a few weeks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard IBC\u2019s music broadcast is taking special care over Pretty Girls\u2019 comeback stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin, who was listening with a slack jaw, swallowed his saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cComeback stage\u2026 But, I still can\u2019t believe it. It felt surreal thinking that the girls are gaining so much attention thanks to the broadcast, but my eyes were about to pop out when I heard the staff wanted to have an interview for their comeback stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the song does well, then an introduction scene will be added as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo said while laughing.</p><br/><p>As soon as they talked about the song\u2019s results, their gazes gathered on me.</p><br/><p>The PR Team employees cautiously asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe song will do well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at the mood, it looks like they\u2019ll rise to the top of the charts. The problem is whether it stays there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are preparing a press release in case it does fall sharply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park trailed her words as she looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow well do you think the song will do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst on the weekly charts.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said with a smile. Team Leader Park licked her dry lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they are a hot topic right now, if we\u2019re lucky it might reach first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park, who was nodding, paused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, did you say weekly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while twirling the pen in my hand. Now the other employees were looked at me with agitated expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot real-time rankings, not daily, but first on weekly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that they\u2019ll be able to stay at the top of the weekly charts for at least one week? I hope they get first on the monthly chart even.\u201d</p><br/><p>I added as the others\u2019 expressions turned strange. If Kim Hyunjo or the team 3 leader were here, they probably would have said something.</p><br/><p>That the crazy guy is doing it again.</p><br/><p>I lightly tapped the back of my hand and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that our goal is settled, shall we start the meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee quickly regained their senses.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Team Leader Park had a faint smile as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we, Team Leader Jung?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>A cold front descended in the team leader\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Management Business Department is going to be reorganized? Who said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo flinched under the team 2 leader\u2019s glaring eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rumor that\u2019s been going around recently. It\u2019s just a rumor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what kind of rumor?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat we should be reducing our investments in Hollywood and focus more here since we aren\u2019t able to get good results advancing into Hollywood. Apparently, they are planning on increasing the department by signing on more A-list actors currently in the free market. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSign other actors? If that\u2019s the case, do you think I wouldn\u2019t be aware of it? The CEO and director would tell me immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader snorted and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat a new team will be created in the department. That team\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo\u2019s eyes sneaked a peek at the team 2 leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rest is completely baseless, so you don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me the rest of it! What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that Jung Sunwoo might be the new team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s been speaking that nonsense?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader\u2019s eyes blazed. His well-groomed beard trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I told you it\u2019s just nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader? Team leader! All sorts of rumors are coming out from giving Jung Sunwoo that temporary team leader position so that it looks good for the company! It\u2019s not like the project succeeded either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, judging by the mood, it seems like it\u2019s already considered a success. The problem is rather if the rest is a big or small hit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo halted his mumblings and shook his head.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader chugged down a glass of cold water. Then he rubbed his belly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to be careful around the CEO and director because of that Jung Sunwoo bastard. My insides broil whenever I hear his name now. He and Son Chaeoyoung are the biggest contributors to my stress. What team leader. Do you think I\u2019ll\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Still holding his glass, the team 2 leader stopped talking when he looked towards the door.</p><br/><p>Song Inho was standing behind the slight opening.</p><br/><p>\u201cInho, why are you standing there like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knocked, but I didn\u2019t think you heard me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Song Inho stepped in, the freezing office began to melt.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader smiled like a goose nesting on a golden egg.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the independent film is going to delay its release a bit longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile was wiped from the team 2 leader\u2019s face. A bone-chilling breeze blew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a mess. Does that director even plan on releasing that movie this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe extra shoots will be done soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many times have you brought extra shoots up? Once you start promoting your project, you\u2019ll be so busy you\u2019ll have to make use of every second. How long do you plan on being bogged down by that? You\u2019re good overall, but you\u2019re stubborn about the oddest things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure that it doesn\u2019t affect my schedule. For sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader\u2019s expression relaxed after Song Inho begged him for a while.</p><br/><p>He sat Song Inho closer to him. Then he scanned his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to the esthetician regularly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to take care since you\u2019ll be in front of the camera every day once Director Yoon\u2019s movie is released.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader patted Song Inho\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just need to follow me from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The meetings were packed as much as Neptune\u2019s schedule during event season. I only picked out the most important ones, but the lunch meetings overlapped so I would have to lunch several times today. I went down to the parking lot to go to my first meeting destination.</p><br/><p>I checked the time in front of my minivan.</p><br/><p>Someone pulled my arm from behind me.</p><br/><p>Was it one of Blackout\u2019s stalker fans?</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I turned around. I saw a face that could be considered too handsome underneath his baseball cap. He was Song Inho. When I relaxed, he pulled my arm. He crammed his long limbs into the security cameras\u2019 dead spot and greeted me,</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, it\u2019s been a while!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been a while. But what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like we were a celebrity couple hiding from reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I get caught talking to you, I\u2019ll be in trouble. The team 2 leader isn\u2019t in a good mood right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho\u2019s voice became quieter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the company is in a frenzy because of your project team. That\u2019s why there are two names you should never bring up in front of the team 2 leader. Son Chaeyoung sunbae and Temporary Team Leader Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was on the same level as Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>Laughing, I placed my hand on Song Inho\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Song Inho laughed refreshingly. Soon, his eyes met mine. It had only been a few months since he came over and cried, saying that he felt like he was suffocating to death, and I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to talk to him much after because I was so caught up with Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are the two movies going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are doing extra shoots for the independent film. Director Yoon\u2019s film is being released. It\u2019ll be in theatres soon. I think they are rushing it because of the distribution company.\u201d</p><br/><p>The movie the team 2 leader picked.</p><br/><p>The scenario wasn\u2019t bad, but how did he pick it? How well would it do?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the premiere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. But, hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still crouched, Song Inho came closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about this just now, but there is a rumor that the management team is being reorganized and that they will create a new team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is also a rumor that you might be the team leader of the new team.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled the time I had a private conversation with CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>So a rumor was spreading?</p><br/><p>It seemed he saw something in my expression as Song Inho\u2019s complexion brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf, that really is true, hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho grabbed both my arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you bring me to your team?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>What the heck? Was this a dream?</p><br/><p>I was definitely talking to Song Inho just now, but I saw the blue sky in front of me. Clouds were trailing on behind the glass wall. It looked like I was looking down from a plane.</p><br/><p>I felt a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Where did I see this before?</p><br/><p>Ah, I was in my office. My office approximately twenty years later.</p><br/><p>As soon as I realized this was the future, my future self raised his head. Devoid of static, I could clearly see Director Park Woojeong, the middle-aged version of Reporter Park Woojeong. I perked my ears and listened.</p><br/><p>Director Park said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person retired at the peak of their popularity, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Retired? Who?</p><br/><p>Was she talking about Song Inho?</p><br/><p>Reporter Song asked the question that was on my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did that person retire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were only rumors. That the person married into a Chinese conglomerate. That the person was being treated for anxiety. That the person was pregnant. That the person retired in Korea and went on to do theater in the States. There were all sorts of rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pregnant?</p><br/><p>Director Park, who replied in a mumble, shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one knows the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe started when she was a child, so she was great at acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park looked at me and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what Son Chaeyoung\u2019s doing now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>{TL/N: Tried to keep it gender neutral until the \u2018she was pregnant\u2019 part.}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-168\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 168\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-170\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 170\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201451\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

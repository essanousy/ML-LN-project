My throat began to burn. Should I say it\u2019s like having a stress disorder after a trauma? Those experiences, especially the last one, left a lasting impression on my mind.</p><br/><p>I drank my coffee with a sour expression when Producer Choi tried to calm my worries by saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a talk show. There aren\u2019t any missions or games like PBS\u2019s \u2018From Now On, We\u2019re\u2019. If we were planning something like that, we wouldn\u2019t call it a long-term project.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was neither a game or talk show?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2026\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cWriter Hwang, the project proposal please!\u201d</p><br/><p>The main writer handed him the proposal as if she had been waiting for his signal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good Friends\u2019</p><br/><p>The large program logo was the first thing to catch my eye.</p><br/><p>Then the subtitle below it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeb drama collab?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there have been all sorts of collaborative projects in the entertainment industry until now. Chef + Food Eating collaboration, collaborations with sports stars, a collaboration with singers for a concert. These all come up from time to time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we want to try a web drama collaboration.\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning over the title page, the proposal was neatly organized into their objectives, methodology, details, and examples. I could immediately tell this wasn\u2019t something they suddenly came up with overnight. The producer supplemented my reading with explanations as I flipped through the proposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe members will personally create their own one-episode web drama, and it\u2019ll even be uploaded onto the Web.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe members will create their own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, of course, they have to ask professionals for help for things like directing, filming, and editing. We also plan on having them ask actors to make cameo appearances as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer\u2019s eyes particularly shined when he mentioned cameo appearances.</p><br/><p>Producer Choi continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cOur members are made up of comedians, idols, musical actors, and others so they\u2019ll be able to participate in the web drama in various ways. They may take up actual roles after learning a few things from actors making cameo appearances or even since the OST.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true. If it was a success.</p><br/><p>I took my eyes off the proposal and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo why do you need me, a manager, for this project?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did they want me to ask Lee Songha or other W&amp;U actors to make cameo appearances?</p><br/><p>As soon as I thought this, the main writer replied with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe wanted to ask you to make a cameo appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you, Chief Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could sort of guess what kind of face I was making right now seeing as a crack appeared in the main writer\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. Just a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It is, isn\u2019t it? I was surprised there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The main writer awkwardly placed her hand on her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you really hate that idea. And here I was thinking that you had some aspirations to act.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I just assumed due to your enthusiastic performance with Ms. Son Chaeyoung during the first episode of Royal Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had a hard time because of that. I can\u2019t drink cocktails since that incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reactions from appearing on an entertainment show and a drama were completely different.</p><br/><p>After it aired, I received so many call and texts from my family, relatives, and even those bastards I call friends. It also spread online. Sometimes, a screenshot or GIF would suddenly appear when I\u2019m monitoring Neptune on the internet. Every time I saw it, it felt like space and time was crumbling.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t do it again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe plan on allowing viewers to submit their own scenarios.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Choi went back to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe viewers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe think it\u2019ll increase our chances at becoming trendy if viewer participation increases. We plan on inviting viewers to submit their own one-episode scenarios then showing them to our members and professionals to decide which ones to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The main writer blinked in an exaggerated fashion and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you help us with deciding?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cRoyal Family passed 20% ratings!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hand slammed onto the table. The bottles on top shook dangerously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, I wrote 30 articles on this already! I\u2019m sick and tired of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlive for me! I have to break down news releases their marketing team provides us into multiple articles. I sick and tired of it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to hold a candle to the sun? There are still people writing articles about it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter with sunken cheeks said. He was tapping nonstop on his laptop on his lap. The other reporters who had gathered in the street vendor to exchange information secretly took glances at his screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not writing an exclusive, right? Let\u2019s not screw each other over now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exclusive? I\u2019m just copy-pasting Alive\u2019s press release. Looking on social media, it seems someone was a complete scene-stealer, but I didn\u2019t have the time to investigate so I\u2019m just writing down the review from the screening. I have to write one about Royal Family after this. God damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone seems to be writing about the same thing, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis just shows how incredible Royal Family and Alive are.\u201d</p><br/><p>A female reporter said while gnawing on a piece of stir-fried cartilage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Lee Songha, who has her hands in both projects, is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A thin man replied, pausing from writing his article.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truly amazing person is Chief Jung Sunwoo. He\u2019s the one who chose both of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was an interesting topic for the reporters.</p><br/><p>The table instantly became noisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. First, it\u2019s a fact that Next K-Star had such stellar ratings that it became a seasonal show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing more to say about Cat Guardian Ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe also made Neptune\u2019s mini-album a hit. By pushing for Lee Taehee\u2019s song to boot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, even entertainment shows. The New Year\u2019s special and \u2018Now, We\u2019re\u2019. Both jumped up the real-time rankings when it aired. I almost rubbed my fingerprints off writing articles that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIm Seoyoung and LJ\u2019s entertainment show is also doing better than average.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoyal Family is a mega-hit. Alive is now a matter of whether or not ten million people will see it. There were probably a ton of reporters ready to knock him down a peg if either one of them flopped, but they can\u2019t say anything now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time someone made a point, the reporters made exhausted faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible. He\u2019s had no failures so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what\u2019s his secret? I\u2019m so curious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually looked into it a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>A female reporter with thick makeup joined in. Everyone\u2019s gazes landed on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI normally don\u2019t believe in superstitions, but I went to see a shaman to write an article about Chief Jung. He said that Chief Jung is definitely a head shaman. Apparently, it hasn\u2019t been long since he\u2019s been blessed so he has contact with the gods or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you actually put that in an article?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did. And people called me a \u2018trash journalist\u2019 for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other reporters chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he could see what projects will be a success, then why would he work in this industry? He would go straight to Hollywood. W&amp;U have been sending actors to Hollywood, but they\u2019ve been getting nowhere for years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then what is his secret? Is it really luck? Or he has a disgustingly sharp eye for things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut whether it\u2019s luck or skill, how does he cope with all this pressure?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thin man said with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they\u2019ve seen the results with their own eyes, W&amp;U must at least hear his opinion on things. As for Neptune, they must have complete trust in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are also a lot of people who blindly have high hopes, calling him \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019, and conversely, there are a ton of people waiting for him to fail. Damn it, if I was him, I probably won\u2019t even be able to go to the bathroom from all the pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEspecially now I bet. Because of Neptune\u2019s next full album.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female reporter said while rubbing her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I know, Neptune\u2019s fandom is at a critical state.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune! Hey, is Neptune on standby?\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer grabbed a floor director and asked after coming out of the broadcasting van.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, everyone\u2019s on standby except for Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you forget about Lee Songha! She\u2019s the highlight! A ton of people are going to be watching the live broadcast because we wrote her name in huge letters in the preview, and people gathering in the square right now have been chanting Lee Songha\u2019s name! It\u2019ll be a huge problem if she\u2019s not there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said that they\u2019ll come here right away as soon as they arrive in Incheon Airport. They didn\u2019t get a wink of sleep due to their schedule in China and are coming here without rest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did the writers set such a tight schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because we barely managed to get even this when Neptune\u2019s company kept refusing. Still, the director was really happy that we were able to get Neptune, Lee Songha on the list.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it. Call them again and ask how much longer they\u2019ll take!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the producer and floor director went their separate ways, a university student with a buzz cut moved from behind the broadcasting van. The place was bustling with people holding cameras and cheering items. They were fans waiting to see the singers.</p><br/><p>The student with the buzz cut joined the group of Neptune fans on the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard on the way here, but Songha is apparently coming here without sleeping due to her schedule in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were like adding fuel to a fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe must have it tough going back and forth from China, she should take a break from Neptune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, Songha\u2019s a member of Neptune.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few Neptune fans and Lee Songha\u2019s personal fans glared at each other.</p><br/><p>The quarrel soon heated up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, to be honest, what help is Neptune to Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that! Neptune members are taking losses by letting Songha do her own thing. If not, they probably have appeared in many events and their album might already be out. Their next album keeps getting pushed back because of Songha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to blame it all on her? Lee Taehee still hasn\u2019t finished her song!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the other members are the ones who urgently need the album, it doesn\u2019t matter to Songha. She\u2019ll have a lot of work to do if they start recording and practicing choreography. If the album flops, then she\u2019ll have wasted her precious time and effort!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s better if she stars in a drama or movie in that time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m speechless. Are you saying she should go do her own thing regardless of being in a team or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think Songha is interfering with Neptune, then you should complain to W&amp;U! Ask them to take Songha out of Neptune!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you joking? The members are getting along fine so why are you telling them to take out Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know if they are getting along well or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can tell they are close just by the photos they upload on the official social media accounts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose photos are for the media. It could be that Songha wants to leave, but the other members aren\u2019t letting her! They live together, and Songha is the youngest out of them. How do you know she\u2019s not being mistreated?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! How dare you make assumptions with no evidence! Are you done talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done! I have tons to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>They started flinging curses at each other in the end. While both sides were fighting intensely, other fans were clicking their tongue a few steps away. They held planet-shaped cheer sticks and huge cameras. They were the first-generation Tritons, Neptune\u2019s official fan club.</p><br/><p>A large, athletic man mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shitstorm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? It seems there are more crazies than usual because this is an outdoor performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman with a little baby fat left on her cheeks nodded.</p><br/><p>Another member asked with a dazed face,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are they acting like that? It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve come out due to exams so it\u2019s hard to adjust.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing any of them. Why did such an aggravating crowd stick to Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha-Eating<sup>{1}</sup> unni, are they part of our fandom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are new members who came on thanks to Royal Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating, who was a devoted fan, sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune\u2019s fanbase grew as Songha\u2019s personal fanbase grew, but as the fanbase grows so do the number of haters. They are more like haters than fans. There are a quite a few people squabbling on the official page so the mood\u2019s a bit off these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A man wearing horn-rimmed glasses said with an uneasy expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cOur members don\u2019t really have a bad relationship or anything, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also worried there might be trouble because Songha suddenly became so popular on her own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fandom will become stable once their album comes out and they are performing as a group again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating still glanced at the fighting people.</p><br/><p>One person shouted in a fit of anger,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to kick Lee Songha out of the group, then do it! But you need to leave Chief Jung Sunwoo behind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung is Songha\u2019s manager!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke! He\u2019s been Neptune\u2019s manager from the start!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s split it 50-50!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the commotion grew even louder, a writer rushed over with a security guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so loud here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they are Neptune\u2019s fans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a problem if they are like that until the live broadcast. We should call Neptune\u2019s mana-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Writer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating quickly came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Neptune\u2019s fan club. I\u2019m very sorry for the loud commotion, but it\u2019ll quiet down soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll quiet down?\u201d</p><br/><p>The writer and security guard looked over at the same time. The fight was only intensifying. It looked like it might become physical as even fans and regular people around them started to take notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll quiet down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! If you wait a little longer, they\u2019ll quiet down like a school bell ring- Oh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating, who had been calmly explaining, suddenly brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>A white minivan was entering the square\u2019s parking lot.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> The nickname of the woman with a little baby fat left on her cheeks.

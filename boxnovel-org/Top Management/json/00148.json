What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader asked with a dumb expression on his face.</p><br/><p>My complicated thoughts from this abrupt article were blasted away thanks to the Team 2 Leader. Should I say, no matter what my concerns were at this moment, I wanted to concentrate on the Team 2 Leader\u2019s reaction?</p><br/><p>Everyone was secretly glancing at the Team 2 Leader. Their gazes looked like they wanted some popcorn for the show.</p><br/><p>Belatedly understanding the situation, the Team 2 Leader roughly pushed employees aside and looked at the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what the hell is this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like someone trying to screw over that \u2018team leader, who didn\u2019t have a good eye\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader kindly replied.</p><br/><p>He looked like he was watching the world\u2019s funniest comedy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough they didn\u2019t reveal the team leader\u2019s name, I think anyone with enough connections will figure it out. Look at this. There are tons of upvotes on comments like \u2018Does that team leader hate W&amp;U?\u2019 and \u2018Shouldn\u2019t he write an apology?\u2019 You\u2019re suddenly so famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what kind of lunatic\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s complexion alternated between red and blue as if his blood was flowing in reverse.</p><br/><p>Not a care for his colleague, the Team 3 Leader continued nonchalantly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? Who shot their own team in the back? There are always people like this no matter how many times I tell them to be careful of what they say. What a mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was their source? Jung Sunwoo! Was it you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, the sparks flew onto to me.</p><br/><p>I smiled at the Team 2 Leader, whose veins were bulging as he glared at me, and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If I had an interview with a reporter, do you think they would have only asked me stuff like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>They probably would have had tons they wanted to ask from my relationship with Nam Joyoon to my nickname as \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019. Also, if I wanted to anonymously spill some secrets about the Team 2 Leader, it wouldn\u2019t have ended with such few lines. There would be just too many things to talk about.</p><br/><p>Anyways, the Team 2 Leader seemed to accept my explanation as he changed his target.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who is it? Which bast-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t accuse random people and check your own team.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader said, his face now devoid of a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing as they knew exactly what you said, it looks like it was one of those who attended that meeting with you. So stop checking out whether other teams are on fire and go blow the fire out in your team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader stopped. Then he looked around the office. Besides Team Leader Park, who was on the phone, everyone was looking at him. There were even a few people whose gazes alternated between the Team 2 Leader and their phones.</p><br/><p>In the end, the Team 2 Leader fumed out of the office, only leaving the words that he wouldn\u2019t let the bastard who did this off easily.</p><br/><p>A mix of laughter and coughs spread in the office. I had also begun laughing at some point. The Team 3 Leader was even holding his stomach in laughter. Kim Hyunjo narrowly caught him before he laughed himself off his chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god. This is a monumental embarrassment. This is why you need to be kind to others. How are you going to track someone who purposely said that under anonymity? He\u2019s the type to care a ton about his reputation. He\u2019ll be busy with that for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader tapped my elbow and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Lucky Charm. Was it really not you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. If I did that interview, it wouldn\u2019t have ended with embarrassment.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader burst out laughing at my answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny here? It looks like I\u2019m the only one having a crisis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park came over after ending her call with a publication.</p><br/><p>She placed her hand on my shoulder and asked in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you ever receive something from Mr. Nam Joyoon? Like money perhaps?\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA reporter said he heard something like that while he was investigating. That you received a lot of money from Mr. Nam Joyoon to get him on Alive\u2019s cast. Like a \u20181+1\u2019 deal with Lee Songha. They were wondering if it was true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s complete nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>What large sum of money would someone who starved to buy movie tickets have?</p><br/><p>This was so ridiculous that it would even make Lee Songha lose her appetite.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the source?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t figure that out. The reporter removed it from his article because he couldn\u2019t confirm the facts and wanted to check with me first. It seems like there are some people who are jealous of Mr. Nam Joyoon\u2019s success. The press knew that nothing would come out of writing a baseless article.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Team Leader Park grabbed the mouse. She refreshed the page. There were a few more articles about Nam Joyoon and me besides the exclusive article just now. I concentrated on the articles again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTabloids have started publishing already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park clapped her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s quickly send out a press release so that rumors don\u2019t even get the chance to grow!\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, Nam Joyoon\u2019s name was up on the real-time search rankings.</p><br/><p>Alive getting the best opening score, my name, and Team Leader Park\u2019s press release/human documentary about Nam Joyoon and me. This was the result of all three.</p><br/><p>Alive appeared on the rankings again as well.</p><br/><p>SBE Film thanked us for the support and sent out a press release about Nam Joyoon\u2019s casting incident. It even included Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s comments. Thanks to all that, bad rumors didn\u2019t get the chance to surface.</p><br/><p>Comments and social media posts mentioning Nam Joyoon increased explosively in a day. The pictures that were taken back when Nam Joyoon went to a screening with his family also spread online, and the number of people interested in Nam Joyoon grew.</p><br/><p>-Who knows who this Nam Joyoon is? Why is someone I\u2019ve never seen or heard about on the real-time search rankings?</p><br/><p>-He was an unknown actor for ten years and is now experiencing a meteoric rise after appearing in Alive.</p><br/><p>-I looked for information about him because I became interested after watching the movie, but there really wasn\u2019t anything. I think he joined W&amp;U. I hope he works hard.</p><br/><p>-Ah, he became a star after joining W&amp;U? The company really is what makes or breaks a celebrity\u2019s career.</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s not W&amp;U, but due to Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s support. There\u2019s an official article. Nam Joyoon was rejected in a meeting with W&amp;U, but Chief Jung didn\u2019t give up and stuck with him. Then Nam Joyoon became a break-out star in a few months.</p><br/><p>-The hell? This can\u2019t be done by luck. He really must be skilled.</p><br/><p>-Chief Jung, please work with me!</p><br/><p>Even after Nam Joyoon and Alive dropped from the ranking, my name remained on it.</p><br/><p>The number of articles actually grew as time passed. At first, they were simply spamming articles with the official press release as their base, but at some point, special articles with interviews with pop culture critics and people from the entertainment interviews began popping up as well.</p><br/><p>The articles asked how much of an influence a celebrity\u2019s company and manager had on their success.</p><br/><p>They implicated Nam Joyoon and me as well as Neptune with a special focus on Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>I was monitoring people\u2019s reactions to Nam Joyoon, and around half were about him and me. Jung Sunwoo, Midas\u2019s Hand, digging up talents, secret, 2 years of success. Articles, posts, and comments overflowed with such keywords.</p><br/><p>It was stifling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard someone say from behind.</p><br/><p>A blanket over his shoulders, Kim Hyunjo came over while yawning. I looked at the time, and it was late. I thought that my surroundings had been noisy not long ago, but it was now quiet. Only Kim Hyunjo and I were left in the office.</p><br/><p>How long was I sitting here like this?</p><br/><p>I rubbed my dry eyes, and Kim Hyunjo sat down next to me and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be offered a suitcase full of money at this rate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t joke like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke though? Don\u2019t you know how many kids in this industry are grasping at straws trying to succeed? To those unknown singers and actors, I bet you look like a lifeline than a straw.\u201d</p><br/><p>I frowned.</p><br/><p>I had already received a ton of call today. There was an acting coach who asked me to look at some profiles of the kids he\u2019s teaching as well as calls from people whose daughters, sons, nephews, and nieces have been trainees for a few years now.</p><br/><p>Whenever I received a call like that or read an article about me, I felt like a hammer was falling on my head. Maybe my height decreased by ten centimeters today. It wasn\u2019t like this in the past, but at some point, I started feeling the pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you going to go home? Go rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just worried about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if I went home, I didn\u2019t think I would sleep a wink.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone home, chief?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was listening to a few songs sent by the A&amp;R team. I welled up with emotions while listening to the songs. I thought, \u2018They became this successful, huh?\u2019 Although we haven\u2019t collected all the songs, there are more than their mini-album already. The quality is better too. I think we\u2019ll have a difficult time choosing tracks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do if the album flops?\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly asked without knowing.</p><br/><p>It felt like something locked up inside me for a long time finally broke out.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who had been smiling happily, stared at me. Wide awake.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that. It\u2019s bad luck. Even more so if you say it. Why? Do you think it\u2019ll flop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, but I\u2019m just a bit worried. It\u2019s an important album. It needs to be a success-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd are other albums not important? They are always important. And what can you do about it? If you did everything you can, yet it somehow manages to flop, then we just need to make the next one a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said as though it was obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Neptune\u2019s album does flop, they aren\u2019t at such risk that their group will be disbanded. The problem is that the number of bad Songha fans will increase. But we can handle that as best we can. Now that Songha doesn\u2019t an immediate project lined up, Neptune can go on an entertainment show as a group\u2026 What\u2019s with your expression?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour expression is very strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know about my face, but I was feeling a little strange.</p><br/><p>I spoke what was on my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been thinking about what we\u2019re going to do if it fails. Only how will it not flop, nothing can go wrong. We need to make it a success no matter what. Is there any surefire way? Thoughts like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>When did I become like this?</p><br/><p>Was it after seeing Pretty Girls\u2019 future?</p><br/><p>While I was thinking this, Kim Hyunjo asked me with a strange expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never messed up in a big way since you started working? Not once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Nope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why. It\u2019s true your record is amazing in the management business, but there\u2019s no need to be so focused on that. Is your life over if you fail? Nothing happened during the two years after Neptune\u2019s debut so am I trash? No, thinking about it now. I think I used a bad example.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo coughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven CEO Baek, a man of great ability, failed multiple times trying to break into Hollywood. If everything you do works out, then that\u2019s abnormal. If that\u2019s true, then go and establish your own company. Take me along with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo chuckled as he imagined it before continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel so pressured by the press calling you \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 and all that. Are you some national representative? Just think of it as an extra card in your hand. Think about it. Thanks to you, Nam Joyoon reached the top of the search rankings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo slapped my back and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you should just enjoy your work. Have fun. You\u2019re going to go bald if you continue at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t get a wink of sleep.</p><br/><p>For three days now.</p><br/><p>However, tonight was different from the past two days. Until now, my mind felt complicated like it was tangled in knots, but it felt like the knots unraveled a little tonight.</p><br/><p>I kept thinking about Kim Hyunjo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Why did I feel so much pressure? Why was I so stressed?</p><br/><p>It was like Kim Hyunjo said. It wasn\u2019t like my life was over after a single failure. Of course, it would be better if I continued not to fail.</p><br/><p>However, did I really need to success \u2018no matter what\u2019?</p><br/><p>No matter what, no matter what method I used?</p><br/><p>Why did I feel like I had to do whatever it took to succeed? Just why?</p><br/><p>After lightening the pressure weighing on me with this question, my thoughts gradually became clear.</p><br/><p>There was no guarantee that Lee Taehee\u2019s song would be a success, it also wasn\u2019t predestined for failure either. Like Royal Family and Alive.</p><br/><p>Of course, Pretty Girls\u2019 single would be a success.</p><br/><p>There was a likely chance that it would succeed even if Neptune sang that song.</p><br/><p>However, would I be the same person if I did that? After doing that, could I still scorn Son Chaeyoung\u2019s past actions, call Choi Gunyoung a traitor, and consider the Team 2 Leader\u2019s actions as underhanded? When I might be no different from them?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s continue doing as I\u2019ve been.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not dirty my soul and care about what methods I would use.</p><br/><p>After deciding this and clearing my thoughts, I decided to sleep.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>-But chief, it seems like you\u2019re in a great mood today?</p><br/><p>A reporter I didn\u2019t know the name of said in a friendly voice.</p><br/><p>-Your voice seems happy\u2026. Ah, thinking about it, there\u2019s no reason you wouldn\u2019t be happy. Alive sold more than two million tickets. Mr. Nam Joyoon\u2019s popularity soared after appearing on the search rankings yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat could be the case. I slept really well yesterday. It was really refreshing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while driving into an underground parking lot.</p><br/><p>I was on the phone with reporters all morning. My name was still clinging onto the real-time search rankings even after a night has passed. Articles were being published at a steady rate, and it would be beneficial to Nam Joyoon if my interview was referenced in an article.</p><br/><p>Maybe thinking it was another card in my hand really did help.</p><br/><p>They say that life depended on one\u2019s outlook. Let\u2019s enjoy work and be happy from today onward.</p><br/><p>I parked the van and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to get on the elevator now. If you don\u2019t have any more questions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah! Chief, just one! One last question!</p><br/><p>The reporter hastily replied.</p><br/><p>-Did you not see anyone after Mr. Nam Joyoon? A celebrity who you thought would succeed.</p><br/><p>Pretty Girls immediately crossed my mind.</p><br/><p>-Oh, seeing as you aren\u2019t replying right away, I guess you did see someone. Could you-!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to write an article as soon as you hang up.\u201d</p><br/><p>-No, I\u2019m just curious! Just curious!</p><br/><p>The reporter desperately asked about it, but I ended the call without giving him a proper answer.</p><br/><p>Then I turned off the engine and thought in my seat.</p><br/><p>Even if I didn\u2019t bring over the song, I still had the information.</p><br/><p>The information that the unknown Pretty Girls would be reborn with their next single. That they would be first on the charts for at least 2 weeks with the song produced by DOM. I also knew that Jung Jae would be so successful that she would be called the \u2018second Lee Songha\u2019.</p><br/><p>I felt like I could make good use of this information. In a way that both sides could benefit.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, he mentioned that the Pretty Girls\u2019 company wasn\u2019t in a good situation. That the girls had to tailor their own outfits because they didn\u2019t have the funds to get it done. Thinking about how much money it costs to make a single album\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as I decided that I needed to call Chief Lee Taeshin, my phone rang again. It was an unknown number this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Excuse me, is this Chief Jung Sunwoo of W&amp;U?</p><br/><p>The voice sounded hesitant like she was cautious.</p><br/><p>I thought she would be from a broadcasting company or reporter, but she seemed different.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct. Who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I am Jung Jae of Pretty Girls. We saw each other at a live broadcast not too long ago.</p><br/><p>Jung Jae?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>My reply was delayed because it was so unexpected.</p><br/><p>Although I did give her my business card that day, what business did she have with me?</p><br/><p>-I was wondering if we could meet when you have some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? What\u2026 Is this regarding Pretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>-No, I left Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>I jolted up from my seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m having trouble understanding. Did you say you left Pretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes, because I wanted to work with you.</p><br/><p>Now I was even more confused.</p><br/><p>Just what was she saying?</p><br/><p>-You kept looking at me that day. Were you not interested in me? I will work really hard. Producers have told me that my talents were wasted on Pretty Girls, and although we don\u2019t have a lot of fans, I have the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you are misunderstanding something.\u201d</p><br/><p>She cut me off and urgently said.</p><br/><p>-If you tell me your price, I can immediately prepare it. I\u2019ll do anything you tell me to if it\u2019s not money that you want. So, Chief Jung, please take care of me. Like Lee Songha sunbae. Like Nam Joyoon sunbae.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-147\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 147\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-149\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 149\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201408\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

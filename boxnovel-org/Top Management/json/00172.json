The door opened then closed. The noises outside seeped in before quickly becoming silent. I brushed off the sofa, which was messy with the event schedule papers and crumbs, before sitting down.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s organize this. Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>The future I just saw was a repeat. A repeat about Son Chaeyoung. I only heard the same conversation before returning to the present. It was like I was seeing a replay.</p><br/><p>The visions of the future I saw until could be organized into three kinds.</p><br/><p>The fixed version that was around twenty years in the future.</p><br/><p>The staticky future.</p><br/><p>And the final one was a rewind type which I experienced only once regarding the drunk driving incident.</p><br/><p>That was how three boxes were organized in my mind. Three locked boxes that looked identical, but whose contents were unknown. There was now another box. A repeated vision.</p><br/><p>I gripped my clasped hands harder. My skin stung like I was being shocked.</p><br/><p>There were a couple of times when a vision continued from a prior one. The one hinting at Sung Dowon\u2019s downfall. One where I learned that Lee Songha had a talent for acting. However, this was my first time experiencing something like this.</p><br/><p>What was the reason? What was different from the past?</p><br/><p>I had pondered about my foresight ability to the point I was sick and tired of it. This was to identify the true nature of this seemingly randomly activating ability and to also figure out how to use it at will.</p><br/><p>What I realized after thinking about this was that it felt like someone was behind these episodic visions. To show me something. As if that person was trying to push me to change the present.</p><br/><p>A motive.</p><br/><p>If this assumption was correct, then what was this person\u2019s motive in showing me the same future again?</p><br/><p>I had no intentions of stepping into the mud pile that is Son Chaeyoung. But what was the reason behind it?</p><br/><p>Because I judged that that future was useless?</p><br/><p>Was someone hoping I change the future in which Son Chaeyoung retired? Did Son Chaeyoung have something to do with my future? If I burrowed deeper into this repeated future\u2026 Could I gain some insight into the foresight ability?</p><br/><p>I mulled over it before tapping my phone. I searched for that crazy bitch.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s try it.</p><br/><p>I cooled my mind and waiting. However, all I received was a message that her phone was turned off. I felt like I had thrown a grenade only for it to turn out to be a dud.</p><br/><p>I called again.</p><br/><p>-Oh, a celebrity has called. What is it?</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon answered with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something I wanted to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>-What is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen Ms. Son Chaeyoung recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly began to cough.</p><br/><p>-Son Chaeyoung? You\u2019re asking about Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>I also hoped I wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Why are you asking about her all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have my reasons. I haven\u2019t seen her at the company recently, and it seems like Team 2 is less noisy as well. You should know since you\u2019re in the same team. Is there something going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>-There is something going on with her. She\u2019s Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething different?\u201d</p><br/><p>-She\u2019s in the US right now. It\u2019s probably been about two weeks?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe US?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was wondering why the crazy bitch in this area was quiet, so it turns out she had gone somewhere else.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon began to chatter on.</p><br/><p>-It seems like the team leader bothered her with various scenarios and scripts for potential projects. They fought about it and she left for the US. She emphasized that she wouldn\u2019t do any projects unless she liked them.</p><br/><p>I heard him click his tongue.</p><br/><p>-She hasn\u2019t found a project she likes for more than a year. Her cameo appearance on Royal Family was her last.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, Son Chaeyoung didn\u2019t do any projects after Mermaid out of Water.</p><br/><p>-It was her first time taking a break this long, so the team leader\u2019s getting impatient. It\u2019s already a year into her two-year exclusive contract. Although there are discussions that they\u2019ll renew her contract afterwards\u2026</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon changed the subject.</p><br/><p>-Anyways, it seems like she\u2019s become more severe since the CEO held her back when she wanted to null the contract last time. Since she can\u2019t leave with a leash on her neck, should I say it\u2019s like a rabid dog charging at people indiscriminately?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid anything happen in the US?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Why are you so interested all of a sudden? That\u2019s odd. Well, she threw her phone out, so a manager is stuck with her as a messenger. I heard she\u2019s been living a cultured lifestyle, leisurely going to musicals and plays.</p><br/><p>I unknowingly let out a hollow sigh.</p><br/><p>-She\u2019s probably going to return today or tomorrow. She has a commercial shoot.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you let me know if something comes up? I\u2019ll buy you a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Things will pop up like landmines once she arrives in Korea. Although I don\u2019t know what this is about, I\u2019ll let you know.</p><br/><p>We hung up. I sat there rigidly for a few minutes before getting up. I heard a commotion from outside the waiting room. Busy footsteps and voices pulled me back to reality. This wasn\u2019t a good time to be lost in my thoughts.</p><br/><p>I put away thoughts about Son Chaeyoung and my foresight ability for now.</p><br/><p>Then I went to the girls who were waiting for me.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, we are Neptune!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheers erupted in the crowd. Maybe it was because of the overwhelming number of cheering men, but their spirit was incredible. It was like seeing a charging elephant shake the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m Lee Taehee.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m Im Seoyoung.\u2019 The cheers grew louder as each member introduced themselves. I guessed this back when we were surrounded by people and couldn\u2019t move, but their reactions were more heated than ever. It was completely boiling.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee settled Im Seoyoung, whose smile hung up to her ears, back down. Four figures took their position under the misty stage lights. The silence was short-lived. The rhythmical introduction drastically raised the audience\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>At that moment, they were blinding.</p><br/><p>I watched their performance from below the stage. Although I had to wear a hat and a mask, I could feel the audience\u2019s reaction with my skin. Also, I wanted to see them, not from the side or the back, but right here.</p><br/><p>I wanted to see each of them radiate their presence like they were each under a spotlight.</p><br/><p>The audience loudly sang along with them and shouted Neptune and their names.</p><br/><p>Satisfaction bloomed in my chest. I laughed quietly.</p><br/><p>The scheduled twenty minutes passed, and their extra performance began.</p><br/><p>The heated didn\u2019t cool and continued to build. A few hardcore Babel fans protested, bringing up the schedule, but their commotion was insignificant. They couldn\u2019t garner a single ounce of attention from the wild crowd.</p><br/><p>Neptune\u2019s on-the-spot performance was so successful that I was worried for nothing.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Yoon also looked relieved as he approached me. He showered me with thanks and praised Neptune.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, with their ability to mobilize the audience, I think you\u2019ll be able to sell concert tickets?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, when will Neptune have a solo concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>A solo concert.</p><br/><p>Just the mention of that deeply weighed down on me.</p><br/><p>Although boy groups proceeded with solo concerts once they gained sufficient popularity because of their fandom, the meaning behind this word was different for girl groups, whose fandom was usually less active. I had thought that it would be difficult to sell a Neptune solo concert unless we sold it under Lee Songha\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>I slowly looked back at the stage before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBabel members really want to show you all a great performance, but they are just not quite ready yet. This event was made possible with your hard-earned tuition, so of course, you need to see their perfect performance, right? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host spoke slyly, but the front row\u2019s reaction was cold.</p><br/><p>The back rows were quiet because Neptune had heated the mood, but their complaints might spread like cancer cells if the mood degrades. The audience\u2019s passion and enthusiasm cooled down as though they were being doused in the cold rain as the host\u2019s remarks grew longer.</p><br/><p>And behind the stage\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe-we\u2019ll be on our way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGirls, take deep breaths! Deep breaths! Stay calm. Think that you are late into your pregnancies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are high schoolers, dummy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The exhausted Neptune members each said some words of encouragement as they surrounded the goldfish. I could hear the bustling audience from here. The four members of Pretty Girls looked nervous as they were about to go on stage, but they were still courageous.</p><br/><p>The goldfish, who spun around Chief Lee Taeshin, looked up at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, we\u2019ll have a problem-free delivery.\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the host\u2019s voice said,</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of people have been interested in these people these days. They are going to start their official performance right here! The stars of a sudden, special performance!\u201d</p><br/><p>The host pumped up the crowd and as it seemed like it was about to burst, he shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty Girls!\u201d</p><br/><p>I saw the goldfish go out on stage and went back down the stage as well.</p><br/><p>I examined the audience\u2019s reactions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Who are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty Girls, man. But why are they here all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t on the schedule, right? What the heck? Are they an add-on to Neptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdd-on? Can\u2019t you be more considerate considering there are people actually excited about this development?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey seemed fine. Are they going to perform the song they made on the broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>I slowly walked past them as they talked.</p><br/><p>Soon, I heard a woman\u2019s voice, who seemed to be Babel\u2019s fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cA film crew is filming this! We already have bad rumors running around about how we are thoughtless and hardcore because we have a lot of young kids in our fandom. If we slip up here, we\u2019ll be criticized to death! We need to take the lead before they cause any trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, the Pretty Girls goldfish, who came out in a line, bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their voices trembled slightly, but the moment they shouted their clear greeting, an ear-piercing cheer, no, an ardent scream erupted from the direction of Babel\u2019s fandom. The reaction was so incredible, it shocked not only the people around them but Pretty Girls as well.</p><br/><p>Their reactions gradually spread out and behind them.</p><br/><p>Under their deafening cheers, Pretty Girls shouted their chant in a teary voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Girls!\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo handed me the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, there\u2019s a call for you. It\u2019s Chief Lee Bongjoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wiped away the cream on my cheek and neck and answered the phone.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader brought over cake in celebration of Pretty Girls\u2019 successful performance last night, but for some reason, half of it went on my clothes. The sweet smell filled my nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Chief Lee?\u201d</p><br/><p>-You\u2019re in the office right now, right?</p><br/><p>His voice was interspersed with chuckles.</p><br/><p>-Quickly come up to the Team 2 office. Let\u2019s talk.</p><br/><p>Was this about Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>First, I brushed myself off and got up. I told them I was going to meet Chief Lee Bongjoon, and Lee Kwanwoo hastily cut the remaining cake. He packed two slices, saying that Seo Jijoon might be there as well.</p><br/><p>When I went up to their office, Chief Lee Bongjoon was standing in front of the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office while glancing at the office door. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but the team leader\u2019s angry shouts rang outside.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon licked his lips at the plate and my appearance and gestured at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, I could hear a woman\u2019s voice come from inside as well.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon shook his head in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe brought a bomb with her. The reason why she was so quiet in the US must have been to gain momentum before doing this crazy thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bomb?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me that she was going to retire?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of bomb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung said she wants to shoot nude.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Pardon? A nude film? Like a nude scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, a nude photo shoot!\u201d</p><br/><p>The plate slipped from my hand. I managed to grab it before it fell on the floor. I wiped my cake-covered hand on the plate as I tried to decipher this information.</p><br/><p>A nude photo shoot.</p><br/><p>A well-off actress in her twenties, one that was known as the embodiment of innocence at that, wanted to do a nude photo shoot.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she craz\u2026 Ah, she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably not serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon said as he lamented over the mushed cake.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe probably said that she wanted to do a nude photoshoot because the team leader has been constantly pressuring her to pick a project. She\u2019s so protective of her filmography, do you really think she\u2019s going to do a nude photo shoot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, the door of the team leader\u2019s office swung open.</p><br/><p>I saw Son Chaeyoung through the opening. Our eyes met. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s expression became odd when she saw me. I didn\u2019t know whether it was surprise or displeasure, but it was an indecipherable expression. Her lips opened loosely before closing.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s gaze dropped. Her lips became crooked when she saw the cake.</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung!\u201d</p><br/><p>An unpleasant, irritated voice approached from within the office.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to have limits! Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNu-what? Do you want to get cut from all your commercials and have to pay up their fees? Are you going to quit acting? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden after working in this industry for more than ten years? You need to take on good projects when they are begging you to join!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the scripts and scenarios you chose were no good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than doing those, I think it\u2019ll be more worthwhile stripping down for a photo shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung shot back before opening the door wide and stepping out.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader immediately followed after her. He paused when he saw me. His darkened face turned red, pale, then rotten. It looked like it would become moldy soon. He took a ragged breath. Chief Lee Bongjoon stealthily stepped away from me.</p><br/><p>However, the Team 2 Leader\u2019s priority was Son Chaeyoung over us.</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung, Son Chaeyoung! The CEO even\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring up the CEO in front of me. It pisses me off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s! What I mean is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do a project when I want to. So stop pestering me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung skillfully cut him off before turning her gaze. Then she walked towards me.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she was going to pass Chief Lee Bongjoon and me before she stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you think?</p><br/><p>Before I could reply, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I do that photoshoot, I\u2019ll send it to you by phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I have your number.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung lightly shook her phone then passed me without waiting for a reply. Her sharp heels tapped the floor as she left.</p><br/><p>When we could no longer hear her footsteps, Chief Lee Bongjoon mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe crazy bitch is back.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Reference to the pregnancy comment by Im Seoyoung.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-171\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 171\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-173\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 173\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201457\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

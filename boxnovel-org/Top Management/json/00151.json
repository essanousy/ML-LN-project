He gave CEO Baek Hansung a curious glance. As always, it was difficult to tell what he was thinking by his expression. In the end, the director couldn\u2019t hold his question back any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he has a plan. I\u2019ll decide once I hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said calmly.</p><br/><p>The director licked his lips and mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, there isn\u2019t much of a benefit for the company to bear such a large risk. The press will be all over this since Lucky Charm already set a precedent with Nam Joyoon. It\u2019ll mean nothing if their album obtains lukewarm results. They need to be near the top of the charts for this to work, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm must be confident in succeeding for him to push this, but I wonder what he wants to accomplish by bringing Neptune into this as well. What would you do in this situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Like there was no need to think about it, CEO Baek Hansung said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI would make a program.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA program?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA reality TV show so that the entire country can watch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director blinked.</p><br/><p>The meeting between a manager who was successful in all of his endeavors and an unknown girl group that was about to disband.</p><br/><p>People couldn\u2019t help but be interested in this. They could also expect high ratings considering how much of a hot topic this would be. If the program became a hit, then the unknown girl group\u2019s popularity would rise and interest in their single would undoubtedly rise as well. Then, so long as the song was good, they could shoot for first place on the charts.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, the director admired,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis might be worth pursuing? No, we could even push for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He straightened his posture and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe story is good, so it\u2019ll boost our company\u2019s image if we broadcast it. Although Lucky Charm doesn\u2019t like appearing on entertainment shows, I think he\u2019ll think positively on this. Should we bring it up when he comes in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait first.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI curious what his plan is.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we film a reality show of their album production process?\u201d</p><br/><p>I said.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader had nodded their heads, saying that it was a decent plan, but the reactions here were a little strange.</p><br/><p>The director\u2019s strange gaze alternated between me and CEO Baek Hansung, and CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s gaze was fixated on me. He had simply smiled when I had shown them Pretty Girls\u2019 profiles, stage performances, and music videos.</p><br/><p>But it was different now. He looked like he was caught unexpected.</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>I cleared my throat and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I say that I am producing an album with a girl group that was about to disband, the press will promote it on their own. If this can stay a hot topic until the end of the show, the single could get good results as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, it would succeed without such methods since the song was already good.</p><br/><p>However, they would tell me to let Pretty Girls disband and buy the song if I told them that. I would have done the same if the circumstances were so complicated. This was the only method that could benefit both Pretty Girls and me as well as persuade the company.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf professionals in our company help, we\u2019ll package it well and put it on the show. If this is a success, I believe it\u2019ll have a beneficial impact on our company\u2019s image as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>W&amp;U\u2019s image dropped a little due to the anonymous comment about the Team 2 Leader. Also, W&amp;U\u2019s broadcast exposure was relatively small when it was currently becoming more and more trendy for CEOs of large companies, producers, and songwriters to make TV appearances.</p><br/><p>And the most important thing was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I need to talk with them about this, I\u2019m thinking about having Neptune be Pretty Girls\u2019 mentors. Neptune was also unknown for a long time. It\u2019ll also help promote solidarity within their fandom if they appear in this sort of a reality TV show before their next album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t they say anything? I was almost out of things to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are\u2026 all your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we make a show like you say, then you\u2019ll be the star of it. I thought you didn\u2019t like making TV appearances? That\u2019s why the CEO told the Team 3 Leader not to push you if you didn\u2019t want to do them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t like them, but my thoughts changed a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>I still didn\u2019t like being in the spotlight.</p><br/><p>However, I began placing more importance on necessity than my personal preference after my talk with Kim Hyunjo yesterday since my current fame would go up in flames once I fail.</p><br/><p>So while I was still a hot topic as \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to do whatever I can for the celebrities under my care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Pretty Girls\u2019 album is a success, I would be able to use my image to a greater degree next time.</p><br/><p>I was also planning on meeting with the \u2018Good Friends\u2019 staff, who wanted to me to make an appearance, again. There was no reason not to make an appearance if it would help the girls keep their places on their show.</p><br/><p>I was waiting for their reactions when, suddenly, CEO Baek Hansung laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake your own team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour own project team. You\u2019ll be the team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was overwhelmed before I could even be happy that my plan would be put in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake your own team and try it. I\u2019ll be watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader? Team leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director immediately asked as soon as Jung Sunwoo rigidly moved his limbs and walked out of the office. CEO Baek Hansung was smiling brightly like he found this amusing. The director tangled the few bundles of hair he had left.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early to make him a team leader considering his age and experience? It\u2019s also very sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a project team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has to organize the staff then produce and launch the program. This won\u2019t be easy. Lucky Charm has no experience in this as well. Will the team progress smoothly? Even if we publicly say that he\u2019s the team leader on the show since he\u2019s the star, I think it\u2019ll be safer to have someone else lead internally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to use this opportunity to check since he has no experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he has the capacity to lead his own team.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin arrived at NK Entertainment\u2019s office. His lips had dried blood, and his eyes were swollen. He wore a dress shirt dyed with dried blood. A female employee, who glanced at his appearance, said irritably,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask us and try to contact the previous members personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get in touch with them. They said that they had a meeting with a chief here today. I just need a quick word with them before then. Just one minute. Please tell me where and when they will meet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen could you give me the chief\u2019s contact information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t provide that as it is his personal information.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee\u2019s attitude was apathetic. She didn\u2019t seem to want to talk to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen please let the chief know that I must meet the girls. It\u2019s really important.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee picked up the phone after a long time. Someone answered immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Hong, Pretty Girls manager is here right now. He said he wants to talk to you, ah, are you busy? Then I\u2019ll text you his information so if you have time later\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease tell him it\u2019s a contract issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin said. The female employee\u2019s complexion abruptly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, apparently, it\u2019s a contract issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the female employee wrote something down. After hanging up, she handed it to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo here. They are meeting right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were meeting in a coffee shop nearby. Chief Lee Taeshin got in his van and rushed over there. He ran into the coffee shop and saw the two members he had been desperately looking for, Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora, sitting next to each other, sipping their drinks with excited faces.</p><br/><p>The stocky, fat man sitting across from them said,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust think that you were chasing away bad luck until now. This will be the turning point. You girls are lucky. Your timing is amazing. The song has been decided, the choreography is set, you just need to join the group\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyojin, Bora!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two members turned around. Chief Lee Taeshin halted. Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora\u2019s expressions soured as soon as they saw him like he was some unwanted visitor. Park Hyojin asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t bring up the contract, and now what? What\u2019s the contract issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only said that so I could talk to you. I have something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora set her glass down hard on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, why are you acting like this? Can\u2019t you let us walk away on good terms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait. You\u2019ll change your mind if you listen to me. An unexpected proposal arrived after you left. If things work out, it\u2019ll be a huge opportunity for us. A big opportunity that I couldn\u2019t get for you until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin asked with a snort.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin was about to answer before glancing at the man across from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRumors can\u2019t be allowed to spread so let\u2019s talk outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man said while tapping his crossed leg in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk amongst ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ourselves. The girls already signed with us. They are in my care now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin stopped breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo if you want to say something, say it in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man took out a bundle of paper from his bag and waved it in a teasing manner. It was a signed exclusive contract. Chief Lee Taeshin stood aghast as he stared at the girls. The girls had triumphant smiles on their faces the moment his heart was crushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, why were you so hasty\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to take an opportunity when it arrives. We don\u2019t care what you wanted to say. We already got our own big opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin smiled brightly at the man in front of her. Yoon Bora added,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Hong here said that we wasted our time. That he completely regrets how we wasted our time in Pretty Girls. So please stop it. How many times did you text and call us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora\u2019s eyes momentarily turned fierce.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you jealous that we found a path to success? Do you want all of us to die together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin sighed.</p><br/><p>His phone vibrated in his pocket. It was a text.</p><br/><p>{We decided to create a project team. The problem on this side has been resolved. How is it on yours?}</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s expression distorted.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t tell if he was happy or sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll show you the practice room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man and the members left without looking back. Passing Chief Lee Taeshin, who stood rigidly, Park Hyojin asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have anything else to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>I held two full plastic bags in each hand. I locked the minivan and entered the apartment. My phone wavered dangerously in its place between my cheek and shoulder like it would slip out at any moment. A stifled voice leaked out from my phone.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m truly sorry. I wanted to bring them back no matter what\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do if they\u2019ve already signed with another company.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sighed.</p><br/><p>I could still think about this situation from a distance, but Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s emotions should be much more complicated than mine since he took care of the girls since they were trainees.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the remaining member?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Jae\u2019s phone is still off. I called her parents thinking she might have gone back home, but they didn\u2019t even know that she left the group. She\u2019s probably regretting her decision somewhere. If you wait one more day, I\u2019ll definitely bring her back somehow.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up too much about the members who already left. We still have the gold-, I mean, the remaining members. Did you tell them the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Of course, I told them right away.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s voice clearly became brighter.</p><br/><p>-They made a huge fuss when I told them that we would be releasing an album and that they would be practicing in W&amp;U\u2019s practice room. They cried and laughed and ran around the room. I bet the springs on their beds are all shot?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd how did they react to the reality TV show?\u201d</p><br/><p>-They asked me if it was real a hundred times. They almost never made TV appearances even though it\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve debuted. They can\u2019t wait to tell their families. Their parents had it tough all this time as well.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin said bitterly before pausing. He then added.</p><br/><p>-To be honest, I don\u2019t know why you picked us out of all the unknown groups. I\u2019m scared to ask.</p><br/><p>His voice sounded somewhat resolute.</p><br/><p>-Only, I\u2019ll work my best to make sure you don\u2019t regret choosing us. The girls will as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to work together since we now all on the same boat.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood in front of the door after hanging up. I placed my bags down to enter the passcode when the door suddenly burst open.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, come in quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha gestured. She seemed abnormally happy. I smelled something delicious when I entered. Fried chicken, pizza, and pigs\u2019 feet filled the table.</p><br/><p>The girls came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you buy so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought drinks, food, and snacks. I swept through a convenience store.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two hands came out. Lee Songha took the bag filled with snacks, and Lee Taehee took the one with alcohol. I dropped the rest off in the kitchen and took off my coat. Im Seoyoung followed me around with an excited expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come over all of sudden? It\u2019s been a while since you last came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas it really been that long?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy with work recently! Kwanwoo oppa\u2019s the one who picks us up too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, she was right. I used to come over quite often before.</p><br/><p>LJ asked Im Seoyoung\u2019s question again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come over? Is there something to celebrate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, it would be nice if you congratulated me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI became a team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>The living room became quiet. Im Seoyoung, who had been jumping around, blankly stared at me with her mouth agape. LJ and Lee Taehee tilted their heads as if they misheard. Lee Songha looked like she was about to toss me up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPromo-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s only temporary. I\u2019ve been assigned to a project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Do you remember Pretty Girls? The ones who said you were their role models?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 expressions became strange.</p><br/><p>I looked at the four of them. My gaze especially lingered on Lee Songha. Why was I as nervous as I was when talking to CEO Baek Hansung right now?</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to produce their next album.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-150\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 150\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-152\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 152\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201414\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

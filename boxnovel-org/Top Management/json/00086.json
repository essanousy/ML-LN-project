Compared to W&amp;U, it was small, but it was a stable company. While it seemed like there were other celebrities, they focused mainly on actors. I didn\u2019t know any more details besides that.</p><br/><p>Why were they giving this offer to someone who hadn\u2019t even been a manager for five months?</p><br/><p>After racking my brain, I straightforwardly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it perhaps because of Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Kim laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are well aware that Ms. Songha is part of a girl group and has a lot of time left on her contract, do you think we want to be sued? It\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you giving me this offer?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked, Chief Kim exhaled white steam similar to cigarette smoke from his mouth as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, they said they heard a lot of good things about Mr. Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any more than that. Either way, the company said that they would like to meet with you if you are willing. You are probably aware we aren\u2019t some third-rate company as well. This is a good offer.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was why it was so strange.</p><br/><p>The thought about the future which I had suppressed was slowly crawling its way up. Thinking that this might be related to the incident in the future, I added it to my list of suspicions.</p><br/><p>Either way, it wasn\u2019t like I was thinking of changing jobs. While the conditions were good, they weren\u2019t good enough for me to leave Neptune and everything I had built up at W&amp;U behind. Since I felt that there was no need to test the waters, I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile I am thankful for the offer, I do not have any plans on changing companies at this moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Contact me if you change your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>After candidly retreating, Chief Kim took out his business card from his wallet and handed it to me.</p><br/><p>I received and casually put it in my wallet when Chief Kim smiled as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like she\u2019s going to bore a hole in my face. I\u2019ll go in first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Kim gestured with his chin as he passed me. When I turned around, I saw Lee Songha standing there with a shocked expression. She seemed to be taken aback when our eyes met as she quickly pressed the button of the coffee vending machine.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear our conversation?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked after walking to her, she shook her small head left and right.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I did hear a little. I wasn\u2019t trying to eavesdrop, I only heard it when I came to get some coffee.\u201d</p><br/><p>While insisting she was innocent, Lee Songha licked her lips slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m not changing companies. Don\u2019t plan to.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied before she even asked.</p><br/><p>Smiling silently, she raised a paper cup filled with coffee. Then, as if emptying a shot glass, she drank it all in one go. Since her actions were so natural, I only became surprised two seconds later.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it hot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face instantly turned red. It looked like steam would escape from her lips.</p><br/><p>I quickly got her a glass of cold water and she gulped it down in one go. She was acting a bit strange. When I looked at her closely, her expression was fine, but her eyes were wet and wavering like the moon reflected on the water.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem drunk. Did you drink more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lee gave me some.\u201d</p><br/><p>That guy.</p><br/><p>When I looked at Chief Lee Bongjoon, his eyes were already half-closed. Seo Jijoon would probably take care of him. After explaining the situation to people who were asking me why I was leaving already, I left the restaurant with Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Leaving the driving to the substitute driver<sup>{1}</sup>, I got in the back seat with Lee Songha. As the heater warmed the minivan, it seemed she also became drowsy as her long neck leaned to the side.</p><br/><p>I placed a neck pillow under Lee Songha\u2019s neck. Since her quiet breathing was ticklish, I turned my head and looked out the window. The sleet on the window melted and dripped down.</p><br/><p>How long was I like this? I felt like I had fallen asleep temporarily so I stretched my waist when I heard a vibration coming from Lee Songha\u2019s clothes pocket.</p><br/><p>When I left it alone, it stopped soon after before ringing again. On the third time it rang, I shook Lee Songha\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, wake up. I think it might be important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it didn\u2019t look like she would wake up anytime soon, I took out her phone.</p><br/><p>It was her family again.</p><br/><p>Concerned that something might have happened to her family, I answer the phone with one hand while shaking Lee Songha with the other. As soon as her phone stopped vibrating, I heard the sighing voice of a middle-aged woman.</p><br/><p>-Just why haven\u2019t you answe-</p><br/><p>\u201cI answered the call for her. I am Songha\u2019s manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Her manager?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I am Jung Sunwoo. It seems Songha is tired since she is sleeping. I answered the call for her in case there was an emergency.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Jung Sunwoo\u2026 Ah, you\u2019re the one who appeared on the Lunar New Year\u2019s broadcast, right? The one who told Songha to act. I am her mom.</p><br/><p>Her scolding voice instantly became gentler.</p><br/><p>-It so happens I was hoping to meet you in person after watching that broadcast. What a coincidence. Could we meet in person later?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn person? What might the reason be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-I think that Songha should quit the girl group and focus only on acting. Wasting her time\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a hand shot out from beside me and took the phone away.</p><br/><p>Even though it was dark, I could clearly see Lee Songha\u2019s frowning face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she hung up. Since we arrived at Neptune\u2019s residence, I asked the substitute driver to excuse us for a moment. Once he said he would have a smoke and left, Lee Songha immediately said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to see her. Don\u2019t see her. I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this why you\u2019ve been avoiding her calls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha nodded her head. After a moment of silence, I heard a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe fought about this since the Lunar New Year\u2019s long weekend. It seems she was suddenly dissatisfied with lots of things. I looked into it, and it looks that this is a common occurrence in celebrity families. It\u2019s not just us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have said something. If she keeps saying that, the chief or I co-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it on my own since it\u2019s my family matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few thoughts brushed my mind.</p><br/><p>A girl group that only now began taking steps, and a member who came under the glamorous spotlight thanks to a historic drama. Problems concerning personal schedules and how to calculate their earnings.</p><br/><p>I had thought that we were lucky since there wasn\u2019t any disharmony within the group, but there was a family matter.</p><br/><p>Currently, Neptune was on a roll, and even putting the contract aside, if there was discord in the team against Lee Songha, it wouldn\u2019t do well for their image.</p><br/><p>The incident in the future wasn\u2019t related to Lee Songha\u2019s family, right?</p><br/><p>While I became suspicious again, Lee Songha mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, since I was so frustrated\u2026 I wanted to call oppa during the long weekend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have. Why didn\u2019t you? You know my number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I talk about work, it\u2019ll bug you when you\u2019re resting for a change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not work. You can call me next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Lee Songha stared at me. Since it seemed like she would ask me if what I said was true, I nodded. Then a smile slowly bloomed on her calm face.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>As though the raining sleet last night was a lie, the day was bright this morning.</p><br/><p>However, in this room covered in thick curtains, the bleak atmosphere of yesterday remained. There were broken vases and appliances, and books were scattered all over the room. Only the mirror above her dressing table was intact.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung stood in this mess.</p><br/><p>She looked like she would explode at any moment. Her distorted face was convulsing, and her eyes gave off a fierce aura. Son Chaeyoung glared at the wall as though she would rip someone to shreds if they were present.</p><br/><p>Soon, the phone in her hand rang.</p><br/><p>The dial tone rang out in the dark room.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe might really get a mental illness at this rate, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo, whose eyes and cheeks were sunken in, said as he glanced at his phone. On the constantly vibrating screen was the name \u2018Son Chaeyoung\u2019. Clenching his head, he said, as if pleading, to the team 2 leader sitting in front of him,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll probably act more terrifyingly from now on. I feel like I\u2019m going to suffocate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Chaeyoung doing right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably smashing appliances again. I can\u2019t even work up the courage to check up on her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo mumbled as if frightened.</p><br/><p>The team 2 leader clicked his tongue as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true considering her temper. Snatching other people\u2019s stuff, maybe, but she\u2019s not the type of person to have her things snatched away. But it wasn\u2019t just one but a bunch of them. On top of that, she had them taken by Lee Songha, someone who she tried to bury in secret\u2026 That\u2019s why I told you to keep her in check, you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprised by the team leader\u2019s irritated shout, Chief Jo prostrated himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut will Chaeyoung still renew the contract even now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know what kind of person the CEO is? She\u2019s only smashing appliances because he\u2019s got her on a leash. If not, she would have already ripped the contract apart. No, still, why is the CEO going this far\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he couldn\u2019t understand, the team 2 leader frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, there hasn\u2019t been a quiet day since Jung Sunwoo that guy joined our company.\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered before suddenly rubbing his beard. Not long after, he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Chaeyoung won\u2019t be able to work on any projects in her current state for the time being, do you want to be in charge of Lee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had looked like he was about to die just now, Chief Jo\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to talk about it with the director anyways, but we can\u2019t let Jung Sunwoo continuously be in charge of Lee Songha. While it seems like he has a good eye, he\u2019s still a chick who doesn\u2019t know the ways of the industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha, she seems like a real gem the more I see her. Before she becomes difficult to handle like Son Chaeyoung, we need to manage her by assigning a proper manager to her. It\u2019ll be good for her as well if a veteran takes care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo nodded his head repeatedly.</p><br/><p>Even though they were getting ahead of themselves, their conversation continued for a long while.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>It was noisy.</p><br/><p>When I opened my eyes a crack, it was still dark in my room. The cause of the sound was my phone on my table.</p><br/><p>Seeing as the sun hadn\u2019t risen yet, it seemed to be early. Did I set my alarm for the wrong time?</p><br/><p>I fumbled to unplug the charging cable and looked at the screen. It wasn\u2019t an alarm but a call. It was Reporter Park Woojeong. Looking at the time, it was a bit past 1 a.m.</p><br/><p>Did she call me by accident?</p><br/><p>While yawning, I answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, reporter?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, Mr. Sunwoo! Sorry for calling at this late hour. Still, I thought I should tell you this quickly!</p><br/><p>My eyes jolted open on their own when I heard her urgent voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Do you know someone name Lee Joohwan? From Punchline\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guy who raps. I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly got up and turned on the lights. Reporter Park continued to speak.</p><br/><p>-He posted something on his social media just now, but no matter how I look at it, it seems to be aimed at Ms. Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait, I\u2019ll check right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>With my phone against my ear, I quickly went online.</p><br/><p>Then I checked Punchline\u2019s Lee Joohwan\u2019s social media account. Like Reporter Park had said, there was a new post.</p><br/><p>A shitty post that made me doubt my eyes the moment I saw it.</p><br/><p>A lonely night.</p><br/><p>While meeting each other fleetingly on the set over the past few months, I believed there was something real between us. Just what is success that makes a person\u2019s eyes change so much? I turned the drama off in the middle because it was difficult to see your face. Was I foolish? Or was the industry simply like this? How dirty and painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of crazy-!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was so taken aback that I swore.</p><br/><p>Met on the set for the past few months, success, drama, he only didn\u2019t reveal her name, but anyone would think he was talking about Lee Songha. Looking at the comments on the side, Punchline fans were already buzzing.</p><br/><p>They commented about how this was Lee Songha no matter how you looked at it and that she ignored him as soon as she became successful.</p><br/><p>Each comment mentioned Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Reporter Park Woojeong cautiously asked.</p><br/><p>-Ms. Songha, does she really have something with Lee Joohwan? Even if she does\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s speaking nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Then you need to deal with this as soon as you can. When an idol scandal breaks out, only the girl\u2019s side suffers. This is pretty much publicly screwing her over. Since it\u2019s still early in the morning, it\u2019s quiet for now, but it\u2019ll become a huge topic soon!</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, reporter. I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hung up and called Team Leader Park. She was in the middle of a call. Kim Hyunjo was in a call as well. Did they hear about it already? I sent them a message just in case and let out a big breath.</p><br/><p>Was it this?</p><br/><p>The incident I saw in the future. Was this bastard the bomb?</p><br/><p>I did tell the person to hold an interview and explain. The situation fit perfectly.</p><br/><p>In the future, I was undoubtedly threatening someone. It wasn\u2019t a request. I threatened the person by saying that they needed to fix this if they didn\u2019t want to roll in the mud with me. During that time, the other person couldn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>If this was the incident, then what did I threaten him with?</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Not sure what the proper term in English is, but basically, in Korea, you can call someone to drive your car for you when you\u2019re drunk or something.

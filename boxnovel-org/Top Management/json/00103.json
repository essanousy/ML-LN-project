Did they hear everything?</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">My brain churned in thought for a few seconds, recalling whether I misspoke or not and how I currently looked in their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Of course, they probably saw this as a mess.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Still, it was fortunate. Because I was recording the conversation, I didn\u2019t think I made any mistake and the one grabbing the collar was the traitor, not me.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">There shouldn\u2019t anything bad for me.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">It seemed the traitor also finished comprehending the situation at the same time as he quickly let go of my collar. Then he mumbled, \u201cFuck,\u201d in a quiet voice. Seeing his face clearly showing he was screwed, my heart, which shook as though it was hit by a storm, calmed.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cSo, to straighten the situation\u2026 God damn it, it can\u2019t be straightened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">After sitting me down next to the traitor, the team 3 leader rubbed his dry face.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI experienced all sorts of things during my time in this industry, but it\u2019s my first time experiencing such a ridiculous situation. So while thinking something completely different inwardly, this whole time, the both of you worked and talked\u2026 Can we work with kids these days when they\u2019re so scary? Hey, look at him, huh? Look at how out of it he is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">He gestured with his chin. Since Team Leader Park had excused herself already, only Kim Hyunjo was sitting next to him. For a while now, Kim Hyunjo had an expression that read, \u2018What did I just see? Is this real?\u2019 as he stared at us.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The team 3 leader looked at the traitor and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cSo, for the past six months, you intentionally and completely deceived us, right? The words you told me previously were all lies?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Hoping to recuperate the situation, the traitor licked his lips and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI didn\u2019t deceive you, I only tried my best to do well socially\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI already heard everything so stop. You\u2019re sending shivers down my spine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The team 3 leader cut the traitor off. I didn\u2019t notice before because he was pretending to laugh, but his eyes were chilly. Because he was always a cheerful person, I thought of him as a comfortable next-door hyung than my company superior. However, the mood right now wasn\u2019t comfortable in the slightest.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">This time, the team 3 leader looked in my direction.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cAnd you. You were observing him by yourself all this time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cThat is\u2026 I couldn\u2019t recklessly tell you because I wasn\u2019t 100% certain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cHey, you said you heard it from Simon Lee? Then you should have told us then!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cAh, that was a lie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The traitor turned his gaze towards me.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The team 3 leader and even Kim Hyunjo, who was out of it, looked at me with dumbfounded expressions. I glanced at the traitor, who was glaring at me, before saying,</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI only baited him just in case. He\u2019s the one who took the bait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cYou, fucking bastard-!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The traitor, who shouted with bulging veins, faltered. His eyes were red with rage, yet it seemed he was still aware of the team 3 leader and Kim Hyunjo as he suppressed his rage. If the two weren\u2019t here, a chair might actually be thrown this time.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The team 3 leader broke the bloody mood.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cThis won\u2019t work. Sunwoo, you go out for now. No, you can take the rest of the day off.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cPardon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cHow can we talk with the two of you together? I\u2019ll contact you later so just go home and cool your head. During that time, we\u2019ll straighten this guy out, starting with what kind of deal he made with Simon Lee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The team 3 leader waved his hand, telling me to go out. Kim Hyunjo also nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I glanced at the traitor, and it seemed he decided there was no point in keeping up his fa\u00e7ade any longer as his face was surging with irritation. The way he was staring at me was filled with murderous intent.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Not that I cared, I calmly stood up and left.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">While I didn\u2019t know what they would talk about, one thing was certain. The next time I came to work, the traitor\u2019s spot would be empty. I would no longer have to see his face in the company.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The morning of the next day.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">While spending a non-break-like break, the call I had been waiting for finally arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">-It ended with his resignation. You will no longer have to see that bastard.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Kim Hyunjo\u2019s voice rang out from the other side of the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">So he was fired. It was expected. Well, it was as expected as a happy ending in a fairy tale since the team 3 leader and Kim Hyunjo couldn\u2019t let a person who threatened a songwriter keep working in the company.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cChief, what about the thing with Simon Lee?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">-Damned bastard, he kept his mouth shut until the very end. Younghoon hyung personally went out last night to meet with Simon Lee, but it was the same there. I don\u2019t know what kind of dirt Gunyoung has on him, but he was adamant that there was no deal between them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">He sounded depressed. It was to the point where I could tell just how dispirited he was by his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Well, he was the one most shocked about this incident. He had taken his junior around and trained him, a kind junior who he trusted to boot, yet that junior utterly backstabbed him. It would be fortunate if he wasn\u2019t doubting life.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">-Did that guy call you?</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI waited, thinking he\u2019d call me, but he\u2019s quiet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Seeing his murderous gaze, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if he came looking for me with a knife, let alone calling me. That was why I prepared a sturdy baseball bat, though I hoped I wouldn\u2019t have to use it.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I looked at the clock, which was indicating it was just past 9, as I asked,</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cWhen should I start work again? The girls have a schedule early this morning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">-I\u2019m taking care of that so don\u2019t worry. I have to talk to the girls about Gunyoung anyways, though I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll believe it when I, who personally saw it, am still dumbfounded.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The girls would cause a commotion once they heard.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I imagined the scene while clicking my tongue when Kim Hyunjo continued.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">-I heard you\u2019re meeting Im Joowon with Team 2. The team 2 leader was itching to get at you, but use this opportunity and help him properly to get him to owe you a favor. You can come to work starting tomorrow.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cYes, understood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">After hanging up, I got up from my bed.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">There was a ton of time before my dinner with Im Joowon. Basically, I had leisure time. How could I spend this precious time, which I didn\u2019t know when I would have again, stuck in my apartment? Since I got great news that the traitor was fired, I should celebrate by watching a movie.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When I opened the movie theater app, it was filled with newly released movies. If I skipped lunch and moved quickly, I should be able to watch three movies.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">While thinking about which movies I should watch, I became happier.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Then, an hour later, I was driving my minivan. Not to the theater, but to Paju, Gyeonggi-do.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">With a troublesome fellow in the passenger seat.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cHey, society really is scary. For Jung Sunwoo to get beat up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The most decent person among the troublesome friends I had known since high school, Kim Taewoong said while examining my face. When I lightly rubbed my lips, the slightly torn part still stung.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cWho got beat up? We hit each other.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cYour expression is scary right now. Did you sue him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI got a medical certificate. I guess this is considered an injury as they told me it would take two weeks to heal completely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cReally? Are you going to sue?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cNo, as a precaution in case that bastard sues me first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Taken aback, Kim Taewoong shook his head. Then he paused before asking,</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cWait, but why are you wearing sunglasses? Is your eye also-\u201c</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cNo, if I don\u2019t wear sunglasses, people recognize me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">While no one came up to me asking for a picture and autograph since I wasn\u2019t a celebrity, it concerned me enough with people murmuring at a distance. That was why it became a habit to wear sunglasses when I went out for personal reasons.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cAh, right. You\u2019re famous now. A famous person who appeared on the evening news.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The gigantic guy clasped his hands together and blinked his eyes like a fangirl. Damn it, shivers went down my neck. After constantly chirping about how I was a famous person without caring if I cursed or not, he suddenly became quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">When I turned around, he was constantly glancing at me.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cHey, you\u2019re not overdoing it, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI\u2019m not. I told you multiple times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Kim Taewoong scratched his head at my words.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cNo, to be honest, I didn\u2019t have much expectation when I called you, but I was taken aback when the guy, who\u2019s too busy to meet, readily agreed and came out. You didn\u2019t cancel an important meeting or something, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI canceled my movie tickets. Just know that I cried tears of blood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">At</span><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> my reply, Kim Taewoong exaggeratedly placed his hand over his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cNot something else, but you gave up movies to come here? The guy who cares more about movies than food? For me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cIn your dreams. I came because it was your mother\u2019s request.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cHow cold-hearted. Our love has cooled.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cStop speaking nonsense and tell me what\u2019s going on in detail.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Kim Taewoong, who had been chuckling and joking around, sighed before getting to the point.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cThat is\u2026 My second aunt has an idiotic youngest daughter. She dreams of becoming a celebrity. My aunt gave up and is letting her do whatever she wants so that she\u2019ll end up giving up, but she suddenly said she was going to sign with a company we\u2019ve never heard of before. Because of that, my aunt clung to my mother, and my mother asked me, and I contacted you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Kim Taewoong said while reading my mood again.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cJust listen and check if that company is legit. Also, you\u2019ve probably seen a lot of celebrities while working. She\u2019s apparently filming an independent film right now so tell me if you think she won\u2019t make it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI got it so stop reading my mood, man. It\u2019s gross.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m sorry, bastard. You probably receive a ton of requests like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Requests. A few crossed my mind.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Like he said, after appearing on TV, I received a few calls. The content of the calls was similar. \u2018My daughter, younger sibling, nephew, or whoever aspires to be a celebrity so can you meet him or her once because he or she is a good person.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I heard there were a million celebrity-aspirants in the country, and my surroundings were overflowing with them.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">After listening to what I said, Kim Taewoong blinked his eyes and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cHey, if you think someone\u2019s okay, then does that person immediately become a celebrity?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cHow could it be so simple? The problem is how long the contract will be. Normally, there is a casting manager who specializes in finding rookies. The higher-ups discuss a ton when they bring over a few profiles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> Even when recruiting so carefully, there were more cases where things ended in failure than success. It was the same even when they were promoted by a big company like W&amp;U. The path to becoming a renown star from a nobody was as narrow as the eye of a needle.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">While talking about various things, the road had become unpaved at some point.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">We drove quite a bit down the unpaved road to find the independent film shooting site when we saw a group of people gathered in front of us. Two women and three men. A long-haired woman waved her hand when she saw us.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cAre they trying to hitchhike? In a place like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cI don\u2019t think they are greeting us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I stopped the van and lowered the window. Two women approached us with exhausted faces. I didn\u2019t know from where they started walking, but their foreheads and necks were soaked with sweat despite it being a cool spring day.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cExcuse me. Is this a staff van? We are actors for the shoot this afternoon, but if you are, please give us a ride!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Hearing they were actors, Kim Taewoong stretched his neck out. I also closely examined the faces of the people standing there in case I saw someone I knew. I had seen quite a few independent films when I had the time back in the day.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">However, there were no faces I remembered.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cWhile we aren\u2019t staff members, we are going to the film shoot. We\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cThank you! I thought my legs would break before I even got to act.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The actors poured their thanks on me as they got in the van. Soon, I heard a grumbling voice from the back.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cAre they telling us to act or not? Why didn\u2019t they come when they said they\u2019d pick us up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cMaybe they went to pick up Lee Sunghyun again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cIs he the only actor? What are we? The background? Isn\u2019t the director too mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">\u201cWhat can he do even though he\u2019s the director? If Lee Sunghyun leaves, saying he wants to go all in on a commercial film, he has to change the lead and re-shoot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">I held the steering wheel, ready to drive again. However, for some reason, my gaze kept heading towards the rearview mirror. It wasn\u2019t towards the pretty actresses, who were discussing the sorrows of being unknown, but to a man sitting at the very back even though I couldn\u2019t see his face clearly because of his tangled hair.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Did I see him before?</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">The moment I thought this, my gaze met the man\u2019s.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">Then I recalled where I saw him.</span></p><br/><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-102\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 102\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-104\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 104\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201319\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

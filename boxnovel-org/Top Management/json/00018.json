The day was so packed that the staff and ourselves felt like we were going to die.</p><br/><p>In the company, it was meeting after meeting after meeting. From the PR team that I had met before to Neptune\u2019s vocal trainer, choreographer and stylists\u2026 I think I had meetings with half the employees within a few days. I had already given up on trying to remember all their names.</p><br/><p>During lunch and dinner time, I followed Hyunjo to his external meetings. Once our appearance on Next K-Star was guaranteed, other places started to bite.</p><br/><p>That was why at lunch we would eat with some cable program\u2019s producer, at dinner eat with an employee of an event agency and drink with reporters\u2026</p><br/><p>I realized the reason why managers would get into accidents by falling asleep while driving. This kind of schedule was something that could not be handled with a human body.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t go home yesterday as well. In the few days since I started working at W&amp;U, I was starting to become a poltergeist in the company. A movie I was really looking forward to was released, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to go see it.</p><br/><p>Did this make sense?</p><br/><p>However, they said that this was only a decent amount of work. They said once Neptune becomes a hit and has nationwide schedules and international ones as well, I would miss these days\u2026 That was what Hyunjo told me.</p><br/><p>A man even a grim reaper wouldn\u2019t take. To call that support\u2026</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re going to give me this much work, give me life risk pay! I might actually die!</p><br/><p>\u201cGasp!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was so agitated; I was about to swallow my toothpaste.</p><br/><p>Did I already get anger management issues\u2026</p><br/><p>I spit out the toothpaste and rinsed my mouth. I was deathly exhausted. My face reflected on the mirror had sunken to about half in a few days.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t care who, I just wanted someone to hit me. So I could rest at the hospital.</p><br/><p>I was resting for a bit with my hands on the sink when I heard a noise from the entrance of the washroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow far are you going to follow me for? Are you going to follow me into the washroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, ah, hyung\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two men entered the washroom. One had a normal appearance while the other\u2026 The man who looked great even the washroom, Sung Dowon.</p><br/><p>The man hesitated before telling Dowon.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at the synopsis, hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026 Stop pestering me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already read it and the synopsis is really good. Rumors have spread and there are already a bunch of people who want it. If hyung says he\u2019s not going to do it, I bet someone will probably snatch it right away? Hyung, the director said if you agree, he can sign the contract for $7, 000 per episode.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, I am not going to do any more dramas. It\u2019s exhausting on my body and there are too many cases where the story goes astray.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis project is 100% written in advanced. That\u2019s why I am telling hyung to do it. There\u2019s even a Swiss on-site shoot. Hyung, you said you wanted to go on a trip to Switzerland.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026 Okay. I get it so give me the synopsis. I\u2019ll read it once.\u201d</p><br/><p>How envious. I envied that manager the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sung Dowon looked straight at me and greeted me. I clenched the hand that was holding my toothbrush.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look so tired. You should take care of your health while you work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He even had a great personality along with his looks. He has it all. Has it all.</p><br/><p>When I was admiring Sung Dowon, his manager looked at me with an unhappy expression. Eventually, I left as if I was getting kicked out.</p><br/><p>I wanted to see him more\u2026 No, it was a good thing. If I was there any longer, I might have grabbed Dowon and asked when he was going to ask me to be his manager.</p><br/><p>He said, \u2018I wish Mr. Sunwoo could be my manager.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then did that mean I was going to replace that manager? Or work under him?</p><br/><p>Any way was fine, I just hoped that day would come soon. It must be coming. It was a conversation about how I helped Sung Dowon when he was facing an incident that could end his acting career.</p><br/><p>Although I felt bad for Dowon, since it was going to happen, I wished it would happen soon.</p><br/><p>I will help you with all my strength, so, please.</p><br/><p>I thought that being able to see the future was a cheat skill that gave me the answers to all of my life\u2019s problems, but since I only knew the answer and not the problem-solving process, it was really frustrating.</p><br/><p>However, if it was certain I was going to be Sung Dowon\u2019s manager in the future, I would be able to endure the current trial as though it was a passing typhoon.</p><br/><p>When I entered the office, the traitor was already ready and talking to other employees with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you came?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t smile, you jerk.</p><br/><p>My body was exhausted, but whenever I see the traitor, even my mind felt like it was taking a hit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving in 5 minutes. Since it\u2019s our first recording, he said we have to go early and meet with the staff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s chief?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he had someone to call so he went down first.\u201d</p><br/><p>On our way to the elevator, I saw a whiteboard hanging on the wall. It was the various W&amp;U\u2019s celebrities\u2019 schedules. On today\u2019s date, it had \u2018Neptune-Next K-Star Filming\u2019. I was really happy when I wrote that at that time\u2026</p><br/><p>We met up with Hyunjo and drove the van to Neptune\u2019s residence. I was the driver. Since we had to drive multiple times a day, I couldn\u2019t just leave driving all to the traitor. So I eventually built up my courage to drive and when I did, it really wasn\u2019t all that bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, did you all have good dreams last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe practiced all night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though it was morning, all the Neptune members were filled with energy. And although they tried to calm themselves down, it was cute to see how their expectations for their first filming were clearly visible.</p><br/><p>We definitely were busy together, but why was it while I was in this condition, the girls\u2019 faces looked even better. They adapted to their schedule and once they learned that the first theme was singing, they even put more effort into their vocal training.</p><br/><p>Just what was their secret? Was this the power of supervision?</p><br/><p>After getting their makeup and hair done at the shop, we made our way to the film studio. I listened to the conversation at the back while driving. Hyunjo grabbed the girls\u2019 attentions and was giving them advice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you do the interview, think wisely before answering. You don\u2019t need to rush to answer, so pick and choose your words carefully. Have you guys watched all the programs Producer Joontae has directed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t just say it\u2019s the devil\u2019s editing process for no reason. When producers are editing the footage, they don\u2019t care what intentions you had during the interview. They only care about the text. There are even some that ignore the context and just string various words together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know. We printed out sample interview questions and practiced with each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m not worried about Taehee. Seoyoung and LJ, you guys make mistakes when you flustered so be careful and don\u2019t lose your tempers. And\u2026 Songha, you\u2019re the one I\u2019m the most worried about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo shook his head. When I saw Songha through the rear-view mirror, her blinking eyes showed that she couldn\u2019t accept it. Even I, who was only around for a few days, could understand what Hyunjo was worried about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t express yourself a lot and your straightforward words could easily be misinterpreted. Even your words just now, you asked because you were curious, but if it edited with a weird timing, it could make you look bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point. Your face will be enough so just stick close to your unnis[1] with your mouth closed. I\u2019m also going to keep a careful watch, but you girls need to be careful as well. And when you girls are doing a group interview, try to make it so that it doesn\u2019t get to Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t worry too much, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo and Gunyoung. You guys keep an eye out for the girls too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t the type to watch a lot of entertainment programs so when I went to investigate them I was surprised. The devil\u2019s editing process was much more intense than back when I watched these programs.</p><br/><p>It looked like they would edit aggressively and purposely create controversy. It even looked like they would plan to make one of the cast get insulted to increase the popularity of the program.</p><br/><p>Because of this, there were a few that went on interviews crying while saying that they were the sacrificial lambs of the devil\u2019s editing process and also, some who took to social media to fire shots at the producers.</p><br/><p>I hoped that it wouldn\u2019t happen to Neptune.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know if they received insults due to the aggressive article or if there was something else. I hoped that I could find some hints from the future, but there were no signs of that happening.</p><br/><p>It was like it was teasing me, keeping me hanging.</p><br/><p>Not much time had passed when we arrived at the Next K-Star studio. In the concert hall-sized studio, the staff were installing all the cameras, light and audio equipment and were busy making sure everything was working.</p><br/><p>Since we came early for a preliminary interview, the other idol groups hadn\u2019t arrived yet.</p><br/><p>We made our rounds of greeting and were led straight to the interview room. Inside the room, two cameras and lights were installed and some staff, as well as Producer Joontae and a writer, were present.</p><br/><p>While the members were putting on their mics, we talked with the producer and the writer. To be exact, Hyunjo was the one talking while Gunyoung and I stood beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take good care of us, Mr. Producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does everyone ask me to take care of them when they come for interviews? If you compared my program to others, I\u2019m not that aggressive. It\u2019s pretty much a documentary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like hell it is.</p><br/><p>And quickly Producer Joontae proved his words were false. He would first set them at ease by asking questions like, \u2018What were your thoughts on participating in Next K-Star,\u2019 \u2018are you confident in getting a high score,\u2019 \u2018out of the other seven teams, who would you consider your rivals,\u2019 and then he suddenly handed out a piece of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Neptune think the final ranking would be? From first to last, you just need to write down a rank for each team and why.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026 We need to write the reason as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a simple reason. It\u2019s going to be anonymous so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this really anonymous? You\u2019re not going to announce it as Nept\u2014 team or \u2014Tune team, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. We will ensure your anonymity. We are going to exclude the names and only announce the reasons. Just letting you know, five out of the seven chose Neptune as last place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seoyoung who relaxed the mood with her charming mannerisms stiffened. Although she was able to quickly settle herself down once Taehee nudged her arm, it was probably caught on camera.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll read you just a few. \u2018Neptune is a group with only looks. Without that, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u2018They are participating not because of their potential, but because of their company\u2019s influence,\u2019 \u2018They look like a group that appeals through looks rather than skills.\u2019 Something like that. How are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was worried they might agree, fortunately, they were stronger than I thought.</p><br/><p>This time, Taehee answered with a calm voice instead of Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like how other groups think, not many viewers will have high expectations for us. In some ways, it\u2019s good. A story is fun when it has a twist. Since we are able to leave a big impression solely through our efforts, I like to believe we received a chance that other teams didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know because she didn\u2019t talk much, but she was really good at talking.</p><br/><p>Because she looked confident and cool without trying, she looked trustworthy in the interview. Like a generous type? I understood why Hyunjo wasn\u2019t worried about Taehee.</p><br/><p>But, that\u2019s that. Although they said it was anonymous, their words were harsher than I thought.</p><br/><p>Since they had to consider the images of the idols, I thought they would be easier than the survival audition programs with regular people. If it was like this, it was going to be tough.</p><br/><p>When I looked to the side, Hyunjo\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the washroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>What in the world was he talking about?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the washroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething good happened to you when you went to the washroom. Twice. Just in case, go to the washroom before they start filming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am grasping at straws right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was half-forcefully chased out of the interview room.</p><br/><p>Well, I was going since he told me to, but I was at a loss for words\u2026</p><br/><p>I acted like I was deep in thought and walked around the entrance of the washroom two or three times, but nothing happened. There continued to be nothing from my foresight ability.</p><br/><p>Damn it, let\u2019s give up.</p><br/><p>Since I was at the washroom, I decided to do my business. After washing my hands, I walked towards the interview room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, I didn\u2019t realize that it was meant for me, but I stopped when I heard the next words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Neptune\u2019s manager!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around the man I saw previously, Lemon Girls\u2019 manager, was swaggering towards me.</p><br/><p>Since it was quite for a few days, I had forgotten about it, but he really did come.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to see the faces of the terrible girl group that W&amp;U planted in\u2026 when I saw someone familiar walking around. You\u2019re that asshole from before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>To come all the way here to fight with me, did this person have too much time on his hands?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that asshole that was watching in front of the washroom. Did you stumble in front of Producer Joontae and push your group? I saw the articles the next day, you must have been really busy that night, huh? Huh? Just where did this fucking bastard with no ethics come from? Did they teach you that in W&amp;U?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was a bit surprised since it had been so long since I had seen someone provoking me so publicly.</p><br/><p>When I looked at my surroundings, the only people present were that man and myself.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t confident in fighting\u2026 But that didn\u2019t mean I should obediently turn the other cheek when I was already sworn at.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that I did anything to get sworn at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you asshole?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lemon Girls\u2019 manager tapped my chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what did you say to me? Tell me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I bribed Producer Joontae to replace Lemon Girls with Neptune, I only took the chance since it was there\u2026 When I think about it again, I don\u2019t think I did anything that deserved getting sworn at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you asshole?\u201d</p><br/><p>I said it again since you asked me to, you asshole.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you letting out your frustrations on a stranger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, I was already pissed, but you pissed me off, even more, asshole. You want to get hit, do you? Huh? Are you going crazy to get hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>His figure looked even bigger now that I was in danger. With those thick arms and rock-like fists, it would probably hurt if I got hit.</p><br/><p>Maybe\u2026 Just maybe, I might be hospitalized\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHit me, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHit me. So I can get hospitalized and get interviewed by a reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll need to call Reporter Park Yoojeong.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where did this crazy asshole come from?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>[1] Unni is what a younger female would call an older female.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-17\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 17\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-19\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 19\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201148\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

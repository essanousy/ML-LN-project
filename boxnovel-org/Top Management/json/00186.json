Why-why are you acting like this? What are you planning on doing by barging in?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know either.</p><br/><p>I grabbed ahold of my rationality and thought about it.</p><br/><p>What was I doing right now? Of course, I was angry. Since I was relayed that nonsense. However, what could I do by barging in like this? Was I going to grab the Team 2 Leader by the collar and wreak the place, telling him not to try any schemes? Was I going to pull out his beard hair and swear at him? Ah, that wasn\u2019t a bad idea.</p><br/><p>No, there was no way that wasn\u2019t a bad idea.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s think about this rationally. What I heard from Chief Lee Janghyun was that the Team 2 Leader mistakenly thought that I had stabbed him in the back and was now plotting against both Lee Songha and me.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have any solid evidence or anything.</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s calm down. I stopped where I was going and endure.</p><br/><p>I needed to come up with a plan after organizing my thoughts. Like I had been doing until now. I could look for countermeasures now that I knew the Team 2 Leader was up to something, and I could even find a way to take his plot and turn it around on him.</p><br/><p>This was what my rationality was telling me to do, but my steps were getting quicker.</p><br/><p>Was this how having an impulse control disorder felt like? It felt like my rationality and impulse had completely separated.</p><br/><p>My entire body felt like it was boiling. The flames that surged in my stomach burned my struggling rationality. My mind soon became full of soot that I couldn\u2019t think properly. Each breath I took brought a burnt scent up my throat.</p><br/><p>Yeah, what \u2018calm down\u2019? Why would I exercise restraint? So that I could create sarira?<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>He was going to split Lee Songha and me apart and stab me where?</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t something I should endure.</p><br/><p>I swung the stairway door open and went in. My body seemed to move on its own like during my future visions. Chief Lee Janghyun, who chased after me, panted heavily. It just happened that Chief Jo was leaving the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>He flinched as soon as he saw me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 2 Leader is in, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the occasion?\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately knocked on the door. A voice shouted.</p><br/><p>-What is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>-What? Who?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something I want to talk to you about.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other side of the door grew quiet. Chief Jo looked at me in confusion.</p><br/><p>-Come in.</p><br/><p>I swung the door open and entered.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Around four chiefs hung around the second-floor hallway. Someone brought over instant coffee in paper cups, instead of coke and popcorn. They glanced at the firmly shut Team 2 Leader\u2019s office while sipping on their coffee. Chief Jo stood in front of the door like a statue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mood between them was chilly during Jung Sunwoo\u2019s party.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been chilly for a while. The Team 2 Leader\u2019s been treating Jung Sunwoo like an eyesore before the party. It just blew up at the party. Once because the CEO talked a lot about Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, a second time when Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy people were wondering if the Team 2 Leader lost his touch with Nam Joyoon\u2019s incident. There are people who ask if Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon should consult Jung Sunwoo about their schedules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe celebrities at our company are causing a commotion. I bet the team leader\u2019s head spun this time\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably spun twice. He\u2019s the type to consider celebrities his children. Even though he assigns us to them, he observes our every move like a mother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chiefs\u2019 gazes turned to the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office door once more.</p><br/><p>Someone said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the issue is how Jung Sunwoo acts.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you have to talk with me about?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader asked while looking at me like I was a plague.</p><br/><p>I sat down on the sofa and asked back,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it about me that you dislike so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He made an exasperated expression. He even snorted a couple of times.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you drunk? Completely out of your mind? What are you saying after coming here without any notice?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was asking. I was wondering whether I should grab him by his collar or rip out his beard. That was being out of my mind. Right now, I was on the fence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to talk about this properly once.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while looking directly at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I did anything to make myself out to be an enemy, but I feel like you hate me like one. Isn\u2019t it obvious that I would be curious about the reason why as the person suffering?\u201d</p><br/><p>So let\u2019s hear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you know the reason, are you going to change?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m some stand-up person. Of course, I should change if it\u2019s something I feel is a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, it was a lie that even dogs wouldn\u2019t believe since I wouldn\u2019t be persuaded no matter what he says.</p><br/><p>No matter how much I thought about it, I didn\u2019t think I did something to warrant his actions against me.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader revealed a ridiculing smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I like you? When you have no manners as a baby chick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Calling me a baby chick again. He should treat me as a chick transitioning into a chicken.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou constantly overstep your position. When I lend you a hand to help you out, you try to screw me over instead. Everything you do after joining has been an eyesore, so how can I like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, I couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>From what I could recall, he already began hating me when I refused to become Sung Dowon\u2019s proposal and became an eyesore since the incident with Son Chaeyoung and Teacher Shim Kyungtaek.<sup>{2}</sup> He couldn\u2019t wait to devour me when I refused his shitty proposal of joining Team 2 and managing Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>It only worsened with Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>At this point, I should be the one with the grudge.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that normal?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that all? You were trying to stab me in the back by stealing away one of mine. Showing off by keeping Jijoon next to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was resolute and full of malice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the one plotting against me with ill will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIll will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have something against me because of Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>He observed my expression as he nonchalantly shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo? The mishap with one of Nam Joyoon\u2019s movies last year. You think that I had something to do with it. How outrageous. Looking into it, it seems that there was some trouble between him and the director on site.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I was counting down.</p><br/><p>Three. Two.</p><br/><p>Barely managing to keep my reason intact, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that movie? It\u2019s great that we got out of it. I went to see it when it released, and they edited it so much that it wasn\u2019t the plot I originally knew. Since its budget was 10 billion won, 3.5 million people needed to watch it for them to break even. I guess around 300,000 people did?\u201d</p><br/><p>My ticket was included. I watched it three times. Once with Nam Joyoon, and twice on my own. It was when I was low on energy because of Making Film. My exhaustion washed away like I had taken a nutritional tonic whenever I watched it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we filmed Alive after that, so it turned out to be a blessing now that I think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s expression gradually distorted.</p><br/><p>Like he did before, I shrugged and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I think you are misunderstanding something here. I never plotted to steal Mr. Seo Jijoon from you. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so certain of that. Mr. Seo Jijoon simply came to congratulate me at the party. We at least have that much of a friendship.\u201d</p><br/><p>I would have flinched if he had brought up Song Inho instead of Seo Jijoon.</p><br/><p>Since it was true that I wanted Song Inho.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t simply because I wanted to stab the Team 2 Leader in the back. If it was, I would have acted already. There wouldn\u2019t have been a need for me to repeatedly think about how I could bring Song Inho over without breaking my relationship with the Team 2 Leader.</p><br/><p>If Song Inho wasn\u2019t suffering from being in Team 2, if he adjusted well in that team, and if the Team 2 Leader didn\u2019t hate me\u2026 If there weren\u2019t circumstances that rationalized this action, I would have ripped out that desire by its roots.</p><br/><p>I was excessively cautious of \u2018bad deeds\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t plotting against me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had no plans to.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I replied, the Team 2 Leader snorted. He looked like he didn\u2019t believe me one bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you really didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. But you keep making me think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said. My insides began to boil again.</p><br/><p>Pausing, the Team 2 Leader glared at me. Returning his gaze, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLike you said, there has been some friction since Joyoon hyung\u2019s matter. That\u2019s why I hope you wouldn\u2019t take action against Joyoon hyung, Neptune, or Songha again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to work in peace if possible. I\u2019m lacking energy even if I\u2019m pouring my all into my work. I don\u2019t want to waste it by fighting. I also don\u2019t want to be life-or-death grudge with you either. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader, who was so menacing that it seemed he would wring my neck, suddenly smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think my eyes have gone blind because people around me have been saying my discerning eye has gone down and such? Is your face one that wants to make peace with me? It\u2019s one that wants to properly face off against me. Your face looks like you\u2019re about to ignite a fuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>My face looks like I\u2019m about to ignite a fuse?</p><br/><p>I checked my lips with my hands. I was smiling. This wasn\u2019t something I would be smiling about while listening, yet when did I start smiling?</p><br/><p>My heart throbbed strangely.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know whether it was because of my anger at the Team 2 Leader or because of some strange sense of expectancy.</p><br/><p>I roughly rubbed my lips, then I got up and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s how you see it, then you just need to not ignite the fuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>He simply gave an unpleasant smile.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two, three!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello! We are Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Girls!\u201d</p><br/><p>The goldfish must have bowed fifty times on our way to our waiting room. They greeted whoever we came across, whether that was a celebrity or staff member. Even at the wall. Chief Lee Taeshin was similarly hyped.</p><br/><p>Most received their greeting, but other girl groups sometimes looked at them in dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Neptune and I had been the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Chief Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s team leader, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOops! Hello, team leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar boy group came over and greeted me. I greeted them back. I greeted other celebrities, managers, and staff as well while introducing Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>I continued down the hallway and knocked on the VIP waiting room.</p><br/><p>-Who is it?</p><br/><p>The manager, who stuck his head out the door, opened the door wide when he saw me. The main MC of the day, Park Taepyeong, looked back with an annoyed face.<sup>{3}</sup> A welcoming expression flashed across the same crabby face as in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>I greeted him and pushed Pretty Girls\u2019 backs. They had frozen in front of one of the top MCs in the country. Jung Jae started off with a \u2018Hello!\u2019 before their repeated chant echoed in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take care of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my ears! Don\u2019t ask me to take care of you and just do well on your own!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls stiffened at his irritated reply.</p><br/><p>I felt the girls in Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s care as I sat down next to Park Taepyeong and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease go easy on them today. This is their first time on a public network talk show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it. I\u2019m sick and tired of managers coming in and asking me to take care of their celebrities! But do I really need to take care of newbies like them? Rookies are supposed to learn after being edited out and stuff!\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Taepyeong exaggerated while placing his feet on the table.</p><br/><p>I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time, when you asked me to connect you to Songha for a speed quiz\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! She didn\u2019t answer a single one correctly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it was entertaining. I also saw how you thanked her on social media.\u201d</p><br/><p>I coaxed him, not so much that it was unpleasant. Soon, Park Taepyeong\u2019s gaze alternated between me and Pretty Girls. Then he signed and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay. This industry runs on favors like this. Are you going to be on set the whole time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I came over after pushing another schedule back. I wanted to greet you when I heard you were the MC today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen give us a reaction. I\u2019ll try to give the girls a boost while talking about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will work hard! We will give it our all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Sol shouted at the top of her lungs. The other girls bowed without thinking as well. Maybe it was because they all had clenched fists, but rather than a girl group, they looked like a gang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who showed off that imitation on Making Film, right? Don\u2019t do that, people are going to change the channel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been preparing an imitation of Ch-Team Leader Jung Sunwoo\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh Yeondu and Lee Hwain poked Yoon Sol\u2019s sides. Park Taepyeong chuckled,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo that. The worse it is, the better.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Commonly referred to crystal-like beads found in cremated ashes of Buddhist monks.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> It\u2019s been a while but Shim Kyungtaek was Lee Songha\u2019s acting teacher who Son Chaeyoung worked with to make Lee Songha quit acting.</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> He was the MC of Star Manager in the past.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-185\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 185\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-187\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 187\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201485\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

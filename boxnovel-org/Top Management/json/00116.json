He was an unfamiliar face to me, but seeing as his eyes widened at the sight of me, it seemed he knew who I was. Before the elevator doors closed, the man grumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour company\u2019s great. It can instantly crush a honest article.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was the jerk reporter. As soon as I realized this, I jammed my arm between the doors.</p><br/><p>My company was good? An honest article? It seemed he was dissatisfied that the nonsense article he worked hard to write was going to be deleted, but if it was dissatisfaction, our side had more.</p><br/><p>I got on the elevator and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any ill feelings towards Songha or me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat ill feelings? I understand you\u2019re not in a good mood because of my article, that\u2019s my job. Also, a celebrity\u2019s every movement is newsworthy. It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I acknowledge that there\u2019s nothing I can do about a celebrity\u2019s personal life being newsworthy enough to be an article, I just can\u2019t understand why you would publish an article of complete fantasy if you didn\u2019t possess any ill feelings towards us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jerk frowned when he heard my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit that I exaggerated a little, but it\u2019s not a complete fantasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what part of your article is fact?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, really. I\u2019m already pissed at the fact I have to write a correction. Since the higher-ups are working out a deal, a powerless reporter like me has no choice but to do as they say, but why do you of all people act like you don\u2019t know? I already know what kind of relationship you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what is this \u2018relationship\u2019 that I, the party involved, don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that like you-\u201c</p><br/><p>The jerk began saying in an irritated voice before stopping.</p><br/><p>Then, with a flustered face, he looked at me and muttered,</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. I really thought that the two of you were dating, but seeing your reaction, I realize that I might have been mistaken. If that\u2019s true, then what I wrote might actually be a fantasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jerk rambled incoherently before adding,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I waited in the lounge for a long time, there were no signs that Lee Songha would be coming down.</p><br/><p>Did she have that much to talk about with CEO Baek Hansung?</p><br/><p>I was staring at the elevator when Kim Hyunjo came out from the stairs. Looking at me, he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you tell Kwanwoo to drive Songha home? Good job. Right now, it\u2019s best if-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. She hasn\u2019t come down from the CEO\u2019s office yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? They were done talking ten minutes ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then where did she go?</p><br/><p>When I called her, her phone rang but she didn\u2019t pick up. There definitely wasn\u2019t an elevator that came down from the seventh floor. I sent her a message asking where she was before going up to the seventh floor. I couldn\u2019t find any trace of her.</p><br/><p>I opened the emergency exit door as well, but it was empty. Just as I was about to close the door, I discovered a familiar head on a stair landing.</p><br/><p>It was Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>She was tightly holding her phone with both hands and was crouched down as though she was embracing all the agony and suffering in the world by herself. It looked like she sighed as her slender shoulders moved up and down.</p><br/><p>Frowning, I was about to go down the stairs when I stopped. Lee Songha was wiping her tears with her sleeves. After slapping both cheeks, she jolted up from her spot and ran down the emergency stairwell.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Was she crying just now?</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, oppa. I was late because I had to go to the washroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed she actually went to the washroom as her face was clean.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you talk about with the CEO?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was as you said. Be careful of scandals. Don\u2019t date people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha replied with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Was she acting in front of me?</p><br/><p>I thought she had no talent for lying because she would always be caught right after and tell the truth, but what was this? If I didn\u2019t see her in the emergency stairwell just now, I might not have noticed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I swallowed my words. Employees were glancing at us.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t say anything. It wasn\u2019t a good time to disappear somewhere with her either.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought I should order the recruit to take her home and call her later, Lee Songha lowered her head slightly and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry that I made things difficult for you because of the scandal, oppa. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it your fault? It\u2019s because of that reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf\u2026 Even if you aren\u2019t assigned to me, you will continue to be Neptune\u2019s manager. Also, they are going to assign you to an actor better than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026 If that happens, you don\u2019t need to worry about how I clung to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>So\u2026</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>I called her inside my minivan.</p><br/><p>Like always, she answered her phone after a few rings.</p><br/><p>-Oppa?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one listening now so continue what we were talking about before.\u201d</p><br/><p>I went straight to the point. Lee Songha intentional said in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>-Though I clung to you so you wouldn\u2019t leave, there are other actors interested in you. Others besides Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>-If they change who you\u2019re assigned to, they said they would assign you to an actor more famous and more experienced than me. So forget about how I clung to you. You don\u2019t have to worry about it.</p><br/><p>Just what did they talk about for her, who became nervous whenever the topic of changing teams came up, to say this? Although I knew this wasn\u2019t her true thoughts, I still felt emotional.</p><br/><p>It felt like the thing that had been proudly filling a part of me was deflating.</p><br/><p>Tapping the steering wheel, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes. Even though we won\u2019t be able to work on my personal schedule together, we can still work together through Neptune. Also, if I quickly become successful, I will take you, no, if you\u2019re alright with it, we can\u2026</p><br/><p>Now look at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I clearly heard your untruthful words so now tell me what you really think.\u201d</p><br/><p>-These are my thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>-They are.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat made you think this all of a sudden? Why? Do you not want to work with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>-No!</p><br/><p>Her voice was deafening.</p><br/><p>A flustered voice that didn\u2019t know what to do followed.</p><br/><p>-That\u2019s not it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to work with you, it\u2019s all my fault. I messed everything up. The scandal was because of me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo why is it because of you? Though I don\u2019t know what you talked about with the CEO, I told you to leave it to me because I had a plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pausing momentarily, Lee Songha said in a dragging voice.</p><br/><p>-Even if you had a plan, it probably wouldn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know it, it\u2019s quite decent.\u201d</p><br/><p>-It still probably won\u2019t work. The CEO\u2026 saw the photo.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhoto? What photo?\u201d</p><br/><p>-The one that was going to be released after the scandal article but the CEO blocked.</p><br/><p>The Daily Fact reporter did say something about a deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cA photo of you and me? What do we have to hide? What kind of photo was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a long time, in a voice that seemed like she was saying her last words, she confessed.</p><br/><p>-When you were sleeping\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I molested you.</p><br/><p>I was taken aback by this. Did I hear her correctly?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Moles-</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, explain without using that word.\u201d</p><br/><p>So I did hear her correctly.</p><br/><p>-Before, on the day we ended early in the morning, I touched your face while you were sleeping and a photo was taken of that,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, no, though it is flustering, was there something on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>-I-I also think I put my finger in your mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Oh, you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Sorry, oppa.</p><br/><p>She said in a trembling voice like she was being executed after finishing her last words. Though I had countless things I wanted to ask her, I asked the most important question.</p><br/><p>The question I had held back last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSonha, do you perhaps li-\u201c</p><br/><p>A shout rang in my ears.</p><br/><p>-No!</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cA correction was published so was the scandal really a rumor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung asked while scooping the whipped cream off a brownie.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it was.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I was happy that something new came up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she licked her lips as though she was disappointed, she didn\u2019t seem to completely believe my words. Her gaze, looking at me, was filled with curiosity. Since it would do me no good talking to the paparazzi about my personal life, I immediately got the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the files?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how did you know that I was looking into a drug scandal? I was so curious about this that I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot of friends with good hearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange. I also know a few people, and the only person who\u2019s especially close with you is Reporter Park Woojeong from G-Today. This isn\u2019t something you can hear from a newbie reporter. Who could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that because it\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled brightly as I replied. Jung Hyesung asked me a few more times before shaking her head, seemingly giving up. Then she took out a lipstick from her palm-sized purse.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I wanted were the files.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a USB drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I opened the lipstick lid, it really was a USB drive. I inserted it into my laptop to check and found photos I had been hoping for. Though these photos weren\u2019t absolute evidence, they were good enough for me to use.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it could be leaked, don\u2019t save it separately on a phone or laptop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t the best ones since you might hand them over to some other reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I needed to gift a reporter a newsworthy item, I would have told them something I know. What good would it do for me if I made enemies out of the paparazzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Hyesung twirled her fork as she said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook into Mr. Sung Dowon.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the information that had the lowest risk yet highest leverage among what I knew. As expected, Jung Hyesung\u2019s eyes glittered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he\u2019s a time bomb that could explode at any moment, it\u2019ll probably be best if you looked into him quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>I added before putting the USB drive in my pocket and standing up.</p><br/><p>With a smiling face, Jung Hyesung asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut since we already handed Star Search the proper files and told them about the leak, they\u2019ll probably publish an article within a day or two. Then the discussions regarding Royal Family\u2019s male lead would fall through so is there a reason why you need those files now?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shrugged as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to show off.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>As soon as I arrived at work, I went to find Kim Hyunjo. Although Jung Hyesung said it could take one or two days, I had to move fast because it wasn\u2019t certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I have something urgent to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the team leader and Team Leader Park, no, is the CEO here today?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked this, a strange expression flashed on his face.</p><br/><p>He examined my complexion and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they are probably all in one room. The CEO\u2019s office.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis office?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA person from Well-Made Production came. Even though a correction was published stating it was a mistake, it seemed they were concerned since it was a scandal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The timing was great.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I want to talk about actually relates to them as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo\u2019s expression became odd when he heard me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if you\u2019re going to talk about the scandal, just wait a bit. Younghoon hyung said he would talk to the CEO. I understand you feel frustrated and victimized, but rather than you personally taking action, it\u2019s better-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about my scandal. I have something I want to show them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShow them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I took out the USB drive from my pocket and showed Kim Hyunjo, his expression became even weirder. His face showed that he thought my mental state wasn\u2019t very good right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a USB drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>I inserted it into my laptop and showed him its contents.</p><br/><p>Looking at a few photos while tilting his head, Kim Hyunjo\u2019s eyes suddenly widened.</p><br/><p>Then he opened and closed a few times before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is this\u2026?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately headed to the seventh floor. The team 3 leader, having received a message from Kim Hyunjo telling him to come out right now because it was urgent, was waiting for me in front of the CEO\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>He came over and his gaze alternated between Kim Hyunjo and me before clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, so I understand you guys are frustrated-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the matter at hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>I showed the team 3 leader my laptop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA real scandal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader looked puzzled at my words as he stared at the screen. Soon, his eyes widened. His expression was almost one of astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, is thi-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who seemed quite out of it, said. The team 3 leader\u2019s mouth opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><br/><p>After staring at the screen, the team 3 leader suddenly jolted to his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky Charm, you, how did you, no, is this real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader swallowed his saliva, opened the office door, and entered first.</p><br/><p>I saw a few familiar faces through the open door. General Manager Sung from Well-Made Production and their head of marketing. Across from them sat the director. Though I didn\u2019t know why he was there, the team 3 leader was smiling next to him.</p><br/><p>And, finally, CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>While the team 3 leader was quietly informing the CEO, one by one, the other people\u2019s gazes fell on me. Finally, CEO Baek Hansung looked at me as well. His composed face contained a faint hint of surprise.</p><br/><p>I took a big step into the office.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-115\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 115\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-117\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 117\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201345\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

I hesitated in front of him for a bit.</p><br/><p>Was it okay to ask him before I told Hyunjo? What do I do?</p><br/><p>Damn it! It was obvious what I should do. I don\u2019t know if it was the future or whatever, but in there they said Gunyoung reckless ran to the producer and pushed Neptune. As a result, Neptune was able to appear on the program, while Gunyoung became the company\u2019s Lucky Charm.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t become a retard who couldn\u2019t even take care of himself. Let\u2019s at least give it a try.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Producer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat now..! Ah, you\u2019re from before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Neptune\u2019s manager, Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Joontae\u2019s face slowly calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t properly introduce our members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said they debuted 2 years ago? I know that Blackout is in W&amp;U, but I never knew they had girl groups. They only managed actors before.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I knew this would happen, I would have carried around my bag. It had their profiles inside.</p><br/><p>Although it was somewhat lacking, I showed the producer the album on my phone. It was a relief I saved a few pictures of the members when I was browsing through the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026 There\u2019s a lounge over there. Let\u2019s move there.\u201d</p><br/><p>After flipping through some pictures, Producer Joontae led me to a small lounge next to the elevator. I pressed my stiff shoulders as I followed along. I don\u2019t know if it was because I was nervous, but my body felt stiff all over.</p><br/><p>I sat down and studied Producer Joontae\u2019s expression and eyes. He was looking through each picture seriously.</p><br/><p>Yeah, that\u2019s it, keep looking. Look closer. The more you look, the prettier they\u2019ll be.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are a group W&amp;U put their heart and soul into. As they were carefully chosen from large companies, they are all skilled, great talkers, have good characters and are very motivated.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt more pressured than all the speeches, presentations, interviews I had done until now. There was never a time when my mind was in such a mess.</p><br/><p>I tried to make motions and talk with confidence. I didn\u2019t want to look too desperate, so I took notice of that. I also racked my brain to say one more word.</p><br/><p>The leader, Taehee, is an amazing singer with skills in writing songs. LJ gave off the impression \u2018I\u2019m the baddest bitch\u2019, but, in reality, she lives to tease her members, especially Seoyoung. Seoyoung was naturally good at entertainment shows, so she has some experience on appearing on entertainment programs and Songha was an irrefutable beauty.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even remember what I said during the conversation. I just didn\u2019t stop talking.</p><br/><p>The profiles I saw in the van, the internet articles I browsed through in the salon and waiting room, I used whatever I could to speak positively about Neptune.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune. Neptune, you say\u2026 Not bad. Their visuals are actually better than Lemon Girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the producer\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t bad. I gulped down my saliva as I wait for his decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t they on the list? Was it because the group would soon be 3 years old? If we were to recruit them into the program, would we be able to have some actors from W&amp;U make brief appearances on the show?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere a lot of expensive actors from W&amp;U that don\u2019t make appearances on entertainment shows. I\u2019m not asking for much, just enough to use gain some attention\u2026 How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is something I cannot decide by myself. I will confirm it with the chief and let you know immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a new recruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>I forgot to tell him it was my first day.</p><br/><p>It was good that I forgot. As soon as he heard those words, Producer Joontae absent-mindedly laughed. He looked as though he had nothing more to say to a rookie manager.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? I thought\u2026 So are you here for the music broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you probably came with the girls. Is the chief with you as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be watching their live broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can we meet after the performance? With all the members. Let\u2019s talk once we\u2019ve seen the members. Here\u2019s my business card, call me later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I accepted the business card with both hands, something poked my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around to see Seoyoung panting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyunjo oppa is talking about whether to kill you or not. \u2018It hasn\u2019t been a day, but he already disappeared during a live broadcast. Where the hell did this guy come from?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? What about the performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done already. I came here since the washroom in front of the waiting room was packed. But, I\u2019m not the one with the problem, it\u2019s you, oppa! You have to work to feed the quadruplets, what are you going to do if you get fired on your first day. You lost my fan and even disappeared, you\u2019re getting pretty close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, why do I have to feed the quadruplets?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll cover for you so hurry up and think of an excuse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why is she like this? Was it because she just came down from her performance? She seemed really excited. Like a person who already had a bottle of alcohol.</p><br/><p>Seoyoung suddenly blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, who is the person behind you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gasp! There were more important things at hand!</p><br/><p>As I quickly turned around, Producer Joontae was looking at Seoyoung with laser-like eyes. After looking at Joontae, as if she understood, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Were you looking for my fan you lost earlier? You\u2019re kidding me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello! I am Im Seoyoung from Neptune! Would like an autograph now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGyahh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seoyoung let out a scream and energetically shoved her head down.</p><br/><p>I thought she was doing a deep bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do! I am sorry, Mr. Producer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. Your character is fresh and cute. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seoyoung had an expression that she made a big mistake and was stamping her feet. Any man who had protective instincts would not be able to stay mad at this sight.</p><br/><p>Even Producer Joontae calmed down and revealed a much more relaxed expression, as he massaged his shoulders. And he made a gesture telling me to call him with his other hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, talk with your superior and call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight away, I will give you a call in 10 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed the confused Seoyoung and ran. Pushing my way between the flood of people in the hallway, I ran as if I was in a race. Seoyoung, who was following behind me, kept asking me why we were running, but I didn\u2019t have the time to reply.</p><br/><p>Shortly, we arrived at the waiting room. It seemed like the other members were inside as they couldn\u2019t be seen, however, Hyunjo and Gunyoung were guarding the door.</p><br/><p>Hyunjo was the first to see me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung, go inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly. They\u2019re all changing inside, so you go and get changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seoyoung looked at me with a worried expression, but I pushed her back, indicating she should go. The talk with Producer Joontae went well, there was no way he would kill me, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the guy who went to the washroom do all this time to come crawling back after the performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>What do I do. I think he\u2019s going to kill me.</p><br/><p>As soon as Seoyoung went inside, the veins on Hyunjo\u2019s neck bulged.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething important? So, let\u2019s hear what this so-called important something is, shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it more important than the girls\u2019 performance? You asshole, don\u2019t you know that this is a live broadcast? When you are later assigned to them by yourself, are you going to leave them and walk around? What are you going to do if there is an accident? Do you think I can trust you with the girls like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am sorry. I met Producer Go Joontae while I was going to the washroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>The uncontrollably angry voice cut off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe producer of Next K-Star, Producer Go Joontae. He was looking for a new group to replace a group as one of their members got in a lot of trouble. I was going to tell chief about it, but the signal wouldn\u2019t connect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they were about to begin, I put it on airplane\u2026 No, so what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I caught up to Producer Joontae and showed him pictures of Neptune while I introduced them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cG-good job. So?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe asked if he could talk directly with the chief and the girls. I received his business card.\u201d</p><br/><p>I handed out the business card in my hand. Hyunjo looked back and forth at the business card and my face. The constantly tired and haggard face he had since the morning was dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can see them. Of course, he can see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo, who was motionless like a lagging computer, suddenly hit my forearm.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, first call the producer and ask him where he is and meet up with him. Block him before he meets up with other groups\u2019 managers. While you do that, I will call the team leader and the director and relay the situation to them. And Mr. Gunyoung, since the girls are going to meet with the producer, tell the girls to come out after they are done wearing their outfits again and fixing their makeup. What are you doing, the both of you! Run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>To meet up with Producer Joontae again, I ran until my feet were sweaty.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the situation left my hands.</p><br/><p>The situation was swept up like a river as everything progressed in a hurry. While I clung to Producer Joontae, Hyunjo, who finished talking with the company, and Gunyoung brought Neptune. Although they were still somewhat dazed, they politely bowed at a ninety-degree angle to greet the producer.</p><br/><p>The members had a long conversation with the producer. Although they had to go up when they announced 1<sup>st</sup> place, they still came back down to continue. Luckily, the mood seemed good and it looked like the producer liked the girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything to the girls just yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending the members back to the waiting room, Hyunjo grabbed Gunyoung and me and told us.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you unnecessarily raise their expectations, they won\u2019t be able to sleep at night. Until it becomes certain, keep your mouths shut.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Hyunjo passionately expressed the good points of Neptune. He was so good, even I felt like I was getting bewitched. From what I saw, it looked like Producer Joontae was also partly bewitched as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to discuss it with the writers, but I like them. Their visuals are good, they look like they have good personalities, however even the girl who got a DUI also had a good outwardly appearance. Kids these days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Producer. We are W&amp;U. Have you seen any of our actors cause any problems with their personal lives?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, W&amp;U are famous for being good at their job.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the conversation started to mix in some jokes, the mood was more relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Mr. Producer, how\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how much I am in a rush; I can\u2019t make a decision right away. We have to have an internal meeting. We have to get an \u2018okay\u2019 from the director and director. It won\u2019t take long. Once the DUI article goes up, we will receive a rain of inquiry calls from reporters, so we don\u2019t have much time. We have to find a solution before the program receives a bad image from this incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the program\u2019s chief producer Director Choi Sungho?\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Sungho hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s been a while, our CEO asked if Director Choi would like to talk face-to-face tonight if he\u2019s free\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Do they know each other personally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that they met a few times in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, just a minute. If this proceeds quickly, it\u2019ll be great for us as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Joontae, who was talking with the chief producer, gave us an \u2018okay\u2019 sign.</p><br/><p>While they were talking, the meeting was set up very swiftly. From W&amp;U, the CEO, the management business director and management team 3 leader and from Knet, the chief producer, who was directing the project, and the main producer, Go Joontae, will attend this meeting.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-7\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 7\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-9\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 9\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201128\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Her voice was warm and soft like a just steamed potato.</p><br/><p>It was gentle and slightly out of breath.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m on the fourth floor after my workout, but you\u2019re not here.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m at Son\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both my shoulders were gripped tightly. I was pushed against the wall. The moment my back slammed against the wall, I groaned out of reflex.</p><br/><p>-Oppa?</p><br/><p>She sounded surprised. At the same time, Son Chaeyoung, who held my shoulders, came up close. She seemed to be on the tips of her toes as her crafty lips came up to my chin. I could see her teeth between her opened lips. I could hear her exhale.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung talked into my phone with a cunning smile.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s breath halted like a bird shot by an arrow before fluttering.</p><br/><p>What the hell was she-! I grabbed Son Chaeyoung\u2019s shoulders and pushed her away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if your quadruplets did something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung stumbled before quickly regaining her balance and replying. Lee Songha must have heard as her breaths became even more ragged. Damn it. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s eyes curved into crescent moons.</p><br/><p>She was a notoriously crazy bitch.</p><br/><p>Audacious, acting however she pleases and bringing out the bad in people. Uncontrollable.</p><br/><p>I wiped my ear and cheek, which her breath touched, with the back of my hand and turned my attention to my phone.</p><br/><p>It was quiet. To the point where I thought she might have fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes.</p><br/><p>She replied immediately. She was calmer than I thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m currently at Ms. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s house. I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah\u2026 That. To persuade her?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that. I\u2019m not going to talk with her for long, so I\u2019ll call you back once we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes.</p><br/><p>I said as gently as possible. Her being so calm worried me more.</p><br/><p>I hung up and turned around to find Son Chaeyoung sitting on her sofa. Her crossed legs looked like snakes. Her pleased smirk was gone from her face as though something bothered her. Expressionless, she stared at me.</p><br/><p>I turned my gaze first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re done talking. I\u2019ll be on my way now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo whatever you want. I\u2019m not going to stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard her snort then her phone ring behind me. Son Chaeyoung answered her phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Did you find it? Not frozen ripe persimmons, fresh ones!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice seemed beyond irritated, sounding like an ax hacking into a tree.</p><br/><p>I frowned, imagining how it would feel if I was the caller. As expected, it was useless. I didn\u2019t want to talk to or get involved with Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>I should give up.</p><br/><p>Determined, I walked towards her door when my vision turned dark.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 She was great at acting, having started as a child actress.\u201d</p><br/><p>God damn it!</p><br/><p>This was my first time hating hearing Director Park\u2019s voice. It was also the first time I didn\u2019t perk my ears at what was being said in a future vision. If I wasn\u2019t stuck like a puppet, I would be screaming right now.</p><br/><p>Why was this happening?</p><br/><p>Why did it have to be Son Chaeyoung of all people? It could have been Neptune, Nam Joyoon, Song Inho, or Pretty Girls.</p><br/><p>Why? Why Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>Words surged up my throat but all I could do was watch and listen. Director Park was looking at me. I could now recite the words that were about to come out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what she\u2019s doing now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder where she is. I would like to see her again.\u201d</p><br/><p>My future self continued the conversation.</p><br/><p>The topic of the conversation was terrible, but it felt like I had finally found the exit to a repeating nightmare.</p><br/><p>Reporter Song asked with shining eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have been her fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was good at acting. There was a movie where she appeared as a college student. I saw that three times in the theatres. I remember seeing it in the morning and immediately buying the ticket for the next screening and going back in.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was my memory.</p><br/><p>A distant memory, back when I didn\u2019t know what Son Chaeyoung did to Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Reporter Song continued to ask,</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Lee Songha became an actress after you left W&amp;U, so the timing wasn\u2019t good. However, I heard that Ms. Son Chaeyoung was a top star when you were still there. The manager of an actress you were interested in. I bet that position was enticing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was. Chief Jo Byunghwan was her manager at the time. I was so jealous of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jealous my ass. However, I remembered this as well.</p><br/><p>When I first saw Chief Jo, I thought that he must have saved a country in his past life. That was before Son Chaeyoung told me to screw off when I tried to help her pick her next project.</p><br/><p>My future self smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough I wanted to, there was no opportunity to get close to her. Ms. Son Chaeyoung was a top star, and I had nothing to show for myself while I was at W&amp;U. I never had the chance to properly talk with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 You must really regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I asked around once I established after leaving W&amp;U, but I couldn\u2019t find her. I eventually gave up.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this fixed future, did Son Chaeyoung already retire by the time my future self established himself? However, I couldn\u2019t estimate when that was with this. I set this crumb of information to the side.</p><br/><p>My future self spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was an actress I really wanted to work with. It\u2019s a shame. Truly.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was nonsense. I got goosebumps on my entire body. It made me recall the future where Son Chaeyoung called me her manager. It was a vision I wanted to rip from my memory.</p><br/><p>Director Park, who had been listening to our conversation, asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Jung, do you not know anything about it? The reason why Son Chaeyoung retired.\u201d</p><br/><p>He flinched.</p><br/><p>I definitely felt the corner of my lips flinch.</p><br/><p>Did my future self know something about it?</p><br/><p>I held my breath for his reply, but the words that came out were vague.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What I know isn\u2019t 100% certain either. It\u2019s no different from a rumor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, the rumor you know, is it among the reasons I mentioned before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, is this off the record?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, as a reporter, this is only to sate my curiosity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park licked her black lips. Soon, my future self nodded.</p><br/><p>It was? Amongst the ones Director Park mentioned? Marriage with a Chinese conglomerate, became pregnant, receiving mental treatment, or in plays overseas? One of these might not be just a rumor but could be close to the true reason?</p><br/><p>Director Park said with a meaningful expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, I heard Son Chaeyoung wasn\u2019t easy to work with. Apparently, she was particularly hard to control, even amongst celebrities. There are rumors that her personality played a role in her early retirement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t experience it personally, I heard that she wasn\u2019t easy to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Easy to deal with? Why couldn\u2019t you just say that she was the crazy bitch of the area?</p><br/><p>My future self slackly propped his chin up. His finger tapped his jaw.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought this for a long time. Perhaps she might have not left the entertainment world if I was her manager. Maybe her life would have changed a little as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said with regret.</p><br/><p>My future self continued with a gentle but clear voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople can always change depending on their environment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm, I don\u2019t know about that.</p><br/><p>There was a time when I did think this\u2026</p><br/><p>Before the traitor, Choi Gunyoung, stuck a nail in my heart.</p><br/><p>The moment I snorted inwardly, my future self calmly added,</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly strengthened my knees. If I didn\u2019t, I might have fallen over in an unsightly fashion. My limbs ached like they were cramping. The Son Chaeyoung I know, Choi Gunyoung, and my future self. They mixed into a sludge in my mind.</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>I turned around again. Then I walked over to the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what are you doing? I thought you were leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t care if Son Chaeyoung was taken aback or not, I sat in the empty spot and slowly organized my thoughts.</p><br/><p>First, the future vision.</p><br/><p>This was already the third time it repeated the conversation about Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>Thinking back at the conversation, one thing was clear. My future self had some regret towards Son Chaeyoung. Whether that was as a CEO to a great actress or if it had something to do with her retirement, I didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Was that why I was repeatedly seeing the future about Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>Because I, the present self, was ignoring the thing my future self regretted? Because he wanted me to change Son Chaeyoung\u2019s future no matter what? If I kept ignoring this, would I repeatedly see this vision?</p><br/><p>I raised my head while rubbing my temples.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung looked at me with an unpleasant gaze. When our eyes met, I unknowingly groaned. Son Chaeyouhng\u2019s expression became even weirder.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden? Do you want me to call 119<sup>{1}</sup>?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat 119? Just give me a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said in loud voice before getting lost in my thoughts again.</p><br/><p>While working with Choi Gunyoung, he nailed a thought in my heart. When he joyfully explained his plan to screw me over, that thought dug even deeper.</p><br/><p>No matter how one\u2019s environment changed. No matter how the present changed.</p><br/><p>Those who were going to betray me would inevitably betray me.</p><br/><p>People didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>I thought the same thing when seeing Son Chaeyoung. Since she entered this industry as a child actress, she must have lived a far from normal life, so her environment made her like that? Perhaps. However, it wasn\u2019t like all child actors turned out like her.</p><br/><p>So I thought Son Chaeyoung was someone like that from the beginning.</p><br/><p>That was why I didn\u2019t want to involve myself with her more.</p><br/><p>However, if that\u2019s true, then what about me?</p><br/><p>What about me, who said that Choi Gunyoung and the Team 2 Leader were my team members in the future and thought that threatening people was easier than persuading them? I told myself to stay alert so that I didn\u2019t become a bad person after seeing that future.</p><br/><p>If people couldn\u2019t change, then neither could I.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, if I could change, then other people, even Son Chaeyoung, could chang\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you acting like this because I said that to Lee Songha? Because I shouted? Moaned? Causing a stir over a word. I told you that I did it because I was curious if your nephews and nieces did something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I let out a stuffy sigh. I wiped away my mess of a mind and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy nephews and nieces don\u2019t do that. They\u2019re old enough to know that they\u2019ll be scolded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you scold me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung snorted and crossed her legs. She even crossed her arms this time.</p><br/><p>As though daring me to try.</p><br/><p>Looking at her, I took my phone out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you said that rainy day in my car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it? You didn\u2019t even listen when I went out of my way to tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me not to tell CEO Baek Hansung?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung stopped. She frowned.</p><br/><p>I showed her my phone and looked through my contacts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know CEO Baek\u2019s phone number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her sofa scratched the floor. Son Chaeyoung shot up from her seat. Face red, she was clearly fuming. Even if I try to soften my heart, she makes me shake my head whenever she acts like that. How could she seem even more irredeemable the more I met her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, I!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this is pissing me off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung huffed as she kicked the floor.</p><br/><p>What a temper.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? I won\u2019t do another project! I don\u2019t want to do another project in this company! Don\u2019t you know that the Team 2 Leader suffered in a fight between me and the CEO? I finally got him out\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Got him out?</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Emergency telephone number in Korea.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-177\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 177\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-179\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 179\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201469\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

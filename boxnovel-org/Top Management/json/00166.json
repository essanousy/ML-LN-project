And the reason why everything you touch becomes a success is not due to luck or skill but because your family is supporting you behind the scenes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the best nonsense I\u2019ve heard all week.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader told me a few more rumors that weren\u2019t even good enough to appear on tabloids before leaving. When he left, the few attentive gazes in the lounge also fell back.</p><br/><p>It had been one week since Making Film\u2019s first episode aired.</p><br/><p>Although there wasn\u2019t a quiet day, today was the peak. Maybe it was because we would be airing the second episode today. Being nailed at the center of attention like this was annoying and exhausting. Still, it was worth enduring since Making Film overwhelmingly took first place as the topic of interest this week.</p><br/><p>There was a lot of nonsense mixed in as well, but there wasn\u2019t anything that would result in controversy.</p><br/><p>Once today\u2019s episode airs, the public\u2019s attention would be divided so if I just wait a little longer\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo! Someone who says he went to middle school with you made a post online!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>The female PR Team employee rushed over with a tablet.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park followed behind her with a slightly stiff face as she said the person\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he paired up with you in school. Do you know who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a dark period in my life, so my memories are hazy. Did he say something bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look first.\u201d</p><br/><p>She handed me the tablet. The title of the post was \u2018I was W&amp;U\u2019s Jung Sunwoo\u2019s classmate in middle school\u2019. He even posted a class picture as proof. This was real. There were lots of comments below the post.</p><br/><p>Did I do something in middle school? Or was there someone who had it out for me?</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and read the post.</p><br/><p>I transferred to a new school during my second year of middle school, and I was paired with Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>He looked like a criminal (He currently looks like a model student compared to then) so I thought it would be tough to become friends. He slept all day. Even the teachers who woke sleeping students during their class didn\u2019t touch Jung Sunwoo. That\u2019s why I thought I was paired with a complete delinquent that even teachers couldn\u2019t do anything about. I trembled, thinking I was screwed.</p><br/><p>But it turns out Jung Sunwoo\u2019s quadruplet niece and nephews were babies back then so he couldn\u2019t get any sleep at home. They kept crying one after each other. He was taking care of them all day that he smelled of milk, vomit, and poop.</p><br/><p>There are people who suspect the whole \u2018quadruplets\u2019 nanny\u2019 was some sort of image-making tactic because he\u2019s appearing on TV and becoming famous, but I just wanted to post this to say that it was all true.</p><br/><p>People say you never know people\u2019s futures, I never knew Jung Sunwoo\u2026</p><br/><p>I read to the middle before turning my gaze.</p><br/><p>The female PR Team employee and Team Leader Park had erased their serious expressions and were giggling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you don\u2019t know who he is, right? If you were close, people might think you pushed him to it or paid him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we can spread it without worry then. People react the most positively whenever the quadruplets are mentioned. You seem more warm-hearted. If not, there would probably be a lot of people who think you\u2019re full of yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the biggest contributor. The quadruplets are better than the PR Team.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sighed as I passed the tablet back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought something big happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We are constantly monitoring so that nothing big happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park laughed while lightly hitting my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing serious. Most are speculation or groundless rumors. Ah, someone you apparently know held an interview with a reporter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe asked you to buy lottery tickets for him, but he never won. Apparently, he said that your success being all due to luck was nonsense. The reporters wrote a bunch of nonsense to increase traffic-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the team 3 leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe asked me to, so I bought him lottery tickets for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said in a quiet voice. Team Leader Park\u2019s expression immediately became grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe went around telling employees to be careful of what they say around reporters. Where did he go chat with a reporter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park left with noisy steps. It seemed like she would tear him a new one if she got a hold of him.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me the team 2 leader\u2019s discerning eye article was his doing too?</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this, the female employee turned around and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. Mr. Sunwoo, it seems your value has increased. There was a rumor about you on an investment tabloid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of rumor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you received an investment proposal from a Chinese company.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tips of my fingers abruptly stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ll become independent from W&amp;U with Chinese capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were rumors like this for both the team 3 and 2 leaders as well. It\u2019s proof that your value has increased enough that people are talking about you going independent. We already snuffed that rumor out so you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while lightly shrugging my shoulders.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about boxed lunches? We prepare a lot of healthy drinks and the staff\u2019s favorite foods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating suggested as she sipped fresh juice through a straw.</p><br/><p>She was young enough to still have some baby fat, but she seemed composed, likely due to her long experience as a fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard people react well to smokes as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we being too cheap?\u201d</p><br/><p>A young man who wore an expensive luxury watch cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we are going to provide something anyways, why not get a food truck? With entrees, street food, and desert. Ones that look pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a member of Lee Songha\u2019s personal fan page. Songha-Eating narrowed her eyes. As these two glared at each other like cats and dogs, the woman in between cautiously read the mood.</p><br/><p>This was a collaboration with Neptune\u2019s official fan club, Triton, and Lee Songha\u2019s personal fan page. They also included Pretty Girls\u2019 fan club\u2019s representative, which only had a few members.</p><br/><p>The three of them were gathered in an enclosed business room. The reason for the meeting was to decide what to provide the Making Film staff and its scale. They set up this meeting as they couldn\u2019t decide through chat messages and phone calls.</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, Songha-rella<sup>{1}</sup>. I told you we don\u2019t have the budget for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Triton can do boxed lunches. We\u2019ll gather a bit more and send a food truck under Songha\u2019s name. She has Chinese fans, and there are people who gave us money to increase the scale of our provisions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re competing. Neptune is appearing as a group. If we provide meals separately, then isn\u2019t that just creating disharmony? Songha will be criticized if rumors spread.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to take care of Songha so she isn\u2019t so dispirited in front of her unnis!\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-rella clenched his fist as though he was actually Cinderella.</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating\u2019s voice also rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I know, Songha isn\u2019t the type to be dispirited in front of her unnis!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see last week\u2019s Making Film? While the other members were getting airtime by saying things, she couldn\u2019t say a word because she was too preoccupied reading the mood! Also, only her expression wasn\u2019t good in the 24<sup>th</sup> minute when all the members appeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha doesn\u2019t talk much normally! Her expression is usually like that too! Also, why do you bring up rumors when they themselves say they are close? Chief Jung Sunwoo said that they were close!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung is a man! There are subtle details only women can decipher!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man too! Ah, this is ridiculous!\u201d</p><br/><p>The louder their voices grew, the smaller the Pretty Girls\u2019 representative became.</p><br/><p>Smacking her chest in frustration, Songha-Eating glanced at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, Chief Jung might just switch over to Pretty Girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-rella and the Pretty Girls\u2019 fan representative flinched.</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating snorted then added,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe worked hard to create unity in the fandom, but he\u2019ll be disheartened if he sees this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The triangle relationship between Chief Jung Sunwoo, Neptune, and Pretty Girls was a hot potato amongst the fans. Pretty Girls fans didn\u2019t even dare think about it, and Triton and Songha\u2019s personal fans were diligently checking the mood.</p><br/><p>Soon, Songha-Eating took out her phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Chief Jung when a good time will be to provide meals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chief? Do you call his personal number often? Does he answer if you call?\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-rella lifted his chair and went close to Songha-Eating.</p><br/><p>He picked up right away. Songha-Eating proficiently checked their schedule. Songha-rella looked at Songha-Eating\u2019s phone with greed, and Pretty Girls\u2019 fan representative quietly took down the date.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, will Neptune appear a lot in today\u2019s Making Film?\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating cautiously asked in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there is some decent bait, we want to spread it out to the community\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Songha-Eating\u2019s expression became strange. The other two were focused on her phone.</p><br/><p>As soon as she hung up, Songha-Eating rubbed her reddened cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said it was going to rain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said it was going to rain with bait!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to see the broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>I came to my senses after being thoroughly lost in my thoughts. An employee was standing in front of me.</p><br/><p>He asked while simulating drinking soju.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we watch it together as a group? We already reserved a bar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it next week.\u201d</p><br/><p>I picked up my bag and coat and got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to watch today\u2019s episode elsewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a familiar sight.</p><br/><p>The living room gave off a comfy atmosphere like a loft. Lee Taehee was slumped on the sofa like a sated sloth, and the hungry Lee Songha was leaning on Lee Taehee\u2019s legs as she scooped ice cream. LJ was comfortably sitting on the rug.</p><br/><p>And Im Seoyoung was staring at the laptop as she passionately monitored the comments.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, oppa! There are tons of people waiting for today\u2019s episode!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though it hasn\u2019t started yet, there are articles popping up about it. They say the key point is what kind of crazy action you\u2019re going to take this time! There are quite a few who are watching for Pretty Girls. One person said that he tried to look for their charm and became a fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung admired as she excitedly scanned through reactions on community sites and social media.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, there are tons of people asking to let them know when Lee Songha is on! I bet we\u2019ll hit our peak rating when she appears! I hope the producer gave her a lot of screen time. Maybe we\u2019ll pass 10% if things go well?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said excitedly.</p><br/><p>We experienced other entertainment shows, dramas, and movies after Next K-Star. The other girls were somewhat used to it now, but Im Seoyoung always reacted the same.</p><br/><p>As though she was still surprised that they were on TV and amazed they were receiving the public\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cFocus now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said, smoothly taking the laptop away.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung looked surprised like a puppy who had her food bowl taken from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-why did you take the laptop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch the TV. I\u2019ll tell you people\u2019s reactions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have two eyeballs, so I can watch the TV and the laptop at the same time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>She tried to take the laptop back for a short while before becoming entranced by the start of the show. LJ, who was teasing Im Seoyoung, smiled slightly at the sight.</p><br/><p>The living room became quiet.</p><br/><p>The TV showed me, the project team members, Pretty Girls, and Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s faces. Lee Songha\u2019s gaze landed on me whenever I appeared on screen, and Im Seoyoung made a fuss by shaking my shoulders.</p><br/><p>The TV showed how the team to produce Pretty Girls\u2019 single album was created and Pretty Girls, who couldn\u2019t adjust to their suddenly changed circumstances. Then there was an interview about why only three members remained in a group that originally had eight members.</p><br/><p>Why Chief Lee Taeshin was looking for Jung Jae.</p><br/><p>Their past was smoothly revealed. Then a familiar place appeared.</p><br/><p>A white residence covered in ivy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! It\u2019s our home! It\u2019s our home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know. We also have two eyeballs.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said bluntly with a smile.</p><br/><p>Soon, it showed the living room. Cameras set up in various places filmed the girls in various angles. They discussed what to say when they met Pretty Girls. As always, Im Seoyoung was the one who led the conversation.</p><br/><p>The very \u2018un-meeting-like\u2019 meeting ended soon.</p><br/><p>I appeared next and took Lee Songha, who had a schedule. Lee Taehee left, saying she wanted to discuss her song with the producer. Finally, LJ left to meet her friends back when she was an underground rapper.</p><br/><p>The screen grew empty.</p><br/><p>Only Im Seoyoung remained in the living room that was busy just moments ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s done. Is there more later? There probably is, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung mumbled as though it was lacking.</p><br/><p>Even Im Seoyoung on TV thought they were done filming and turned off the cameras.</p><br/><p>As if they were showing how many cameras were set up in their home, the screen split into many smaller displays. A display turned off as Im Seoyoung went around. Soon, the entire screen was black.</p><br/><p>Aside from the small display on the left corner, which was still filming Im Seoyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beside me, Im Seoyoung\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> *cough* Songha + Cinderella = Songha-rella</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-165\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 165\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-167\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 167\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201445\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

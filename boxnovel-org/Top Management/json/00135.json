Below his tall nose, his nice-looking lips opened to say,</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Song Inho, a rookie actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was that voice.</p><br/><p>The one that was in tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am 22 years old. Please take care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the most handsome amongst the rookies I\u2019ve seen this year. You\u2019re exactly the Team 2 Leader\u2019s type.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park said with a laugh before pressing my back again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Tell him that you think he\u2019ll do well. You\u2019re the highly influential Midas\u2019s Hand. Even if it\u2019s the same compliment that everyone else says, won\u2019t it feel different coming from you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes, I think you\u2019ll do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice was surprisingly normal.</p><br/><p>Even though a bomb went off in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll do my best from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, do your best and get the rookie award! I\u2019ll promote the heck out of you in the press.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park and Song Inho chatted friendlily.</p><br/><p>I simply went along with them. My mind was filled with a single thought.</p><br/><p>The future I had seen just now. To be exact, Song Inho who was giving his acceptance speech.</p><br/><p>While I couldn\u2019t be certain due to the static and makeup, he looked the same as he did now. The scene took place in the near future.</p><br/><p>Was it the rookie award?</p><br/><p>This year? Or the next?</p><br/><p>My stomach began to boil.</p><br/><p>What I need right now, what I desperately wished to see was the future of the people in my care. Neptune\u2019s future, the success or failure of Lee Songha\u2019s next project, and above all, whether Nam Joyoon succeeded as an actor or not.</p><br/><p>Those were the futures I wanted to see.</p><br/><p>Why did I see the successful future of a rookie who I had never seen before?</p><br/><p>And he was selected by the Team 2 Leader to boot.</p><br/><p>How should\u2026 I use this information?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cBring me results.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader said, having called me to the outdoor smoking area as soon as I was done my interview with the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cResults?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe actor you\u2019re fixated on. Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>My head became dizzy once more. Various thoughts pushed their way into my mind.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Choi Sungwon\u2019s project, you said his role in that will be quite small? Since he\u2019s a rookie in a commercial film, that\u2019s fine too. Only, even if it\u2019s one scene, it just needs to be impactful.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said while exhaling cigarette smoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what the director tells me, it seems the CEO is somewhat interested in that fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung was?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen a contrac-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rookies the Team 2 Leader selected this time, the woman\u2019s Im Hyorim and the other is Song, Song something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Song Inho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, him. The Team 2 Leader said that they were much better than Nam Joyoon. The CEO seems interested since the Team 2 Leader and your opinions are divided. He wants to know who\u2019s eye to trust more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, discerning eye. Isn\u2019t that what\u2019s most important to a management company? Selecting rookies is the Team 2 Leader\u2019s concern, but if yours brings back results before his, then he won\u2019t be able to utter a single word.\u201d</p><br/><p>The edges of his lips curving upwards, the Team 3 Leader continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director was having a blast telling me about this. It seems like the news will quickly spread throughout the company. People might even start betting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the Team 3 Leader looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m curious as well. I saw Nam Joyoon\u2019s profile a few times, but I couldn\u2019t see anything special.\u201d</p><br/><p>He patted my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s worth trusting your eye for things.\u201d</p><br/><p>My throat felt dry.</p><br/><p>I swallowed my saliva. My throat still felt parched.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo bring me results. Then I can make what you want happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>What should I do?</p><br/><p>Left by myself, I looked down at the city shining in neon lights as I thought about it.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that Song Inho received an award at an awards ceremony. Whether that was a rookie award or not, it was a successful result since there were tons of actors who never got invited to ceremonies like that.</p><br/><p>If I don\u2019t change the future, I would see that future in real life.</p><br/><p>What would happen to Nam Joyoon?</p><br/><p>What lay in Nam Joyoon\u2019s future, which was currently covered in a thick fog?</p><br/><p>The ground seemed to shake. Would Director Choi Sungwon be able to capture what I saw in Nam Joyoon on film? Then would he leave a strong impression on people?</p><br/><p>If that didn\u2019t happen\u2026 What should I do if my eyes were wrong?</p><br/><p>And if that was why I couldn\u2019t see Nam Joyoon\u2019s future?</p><br/><p>What if this movie wasn\u2019t a success?</p><br/><p>Then the Team 2 Leader would raise his chin up high, saying that he knew this would happen. It would be worse if Song Inho even received an award.</p><br/><p>If CEO Baek Hansung loses interest in Nam Joyoon, would there ever be another opportunity? Would the possibility of me taking care of Nam Joyoon in W&amp;U be lost?</p><br/><p>Something sprouted inside and took root deep in my heart.</p><br/><p>How should I use the information I have to benefit me?</p><br/><p>What should I do to change the future for the better?</p><br/><p>If\u2026 If\u2026 I blocked Song Inho\u2019s path\u2026</p><br/><p>Since there were two rookies, if I made it so that the Team 2 Leader focused on the actress\u2026 Or what if I made a move on whatever project Song Inho would do? What if I gave it to Nam Joyoon?</p><br/><p>Then wouldn\u2019t the person accepting the award at the awards ceremony be Nam Joyoon instead?</p><br/><p>My mind jolted to its senses.</p><br/><p>Chills ran down my spine as though I was drenched in ice water. Even the tips of my fingers felt numb.</p><br/><p>Oh my god.</p><br/><p>Just what was I thinking?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cBro<sup>{1}</sup>, have you ever threatened anyone before?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked while twirling the remote in my hand.</p><br/><p>My brother, who was reading a book that was as thick as the Bible, answered,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were to threaten someone, how do you think you\u2019ll feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>He took his gaze away from his book.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was weird for you to suddenly come here when you\u2019re so busy. There\u2019s something going on isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking how you think you\u2019ll feel if you threaten someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I guess it won\u2019t feel good.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tossed the remote on top of the rug and brushed my hair back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf threatening someone isn\u2019t difficult and obtaining things I want through it doesn\u2019t faze me. Or if I naturally come up with extreme methods when I need to solve something, that\u2019s a bit dangerous, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Did you threaten someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that I was the type to hold long grudges. I made someone almost lose it today. He clung to me, asking me to forgive him, but I left without looking back. And it was\u2026 easy. I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>I clenched my hair and ruffled it vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI might really become a bad person at this rate. A piece of trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma said so!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice abruptly joined in.</p><br/><p>When I raised my lowered head, I saw the quadruplets\u2019 large, clear eyes looking down at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did grandma say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma said that you were so busy taking care of us because we suddenly popped out when you were in middle school that you did stray to the bad side and became an upright person! She said you might have become a scumbag if it wasn\u2019t for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA scum-\u2026 Grandma said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa even called us lucky charms! He said we are wonderful grandchildren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, even grandpa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Four heads bobbed up and down.</p><br/><p>My stomach hurt just moments ago from worrying about the future and a vague sense of anxiety, but I was shocked for another reason right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, was I like that? I always thought I was well-behaved when I was young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t well-behaved.\u201d</p><br/><p>My brother said as he took off his thick glasses.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Xunzi<sup>{2}</sup>? Was I destined to be a bad person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>He touched my ruffled hair.</p><br/><p>His eyes, which bore no similarity to mine, curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t grow up to be a bad person, and you just need to not become a bad person in the future as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had a nightmare.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t remember it clearly, but it felt an unpleasant feeling.</p><br/><p>I let a sigh under my blanket.</p><br/><p>What time was it? If I wanted to catch my flight, I needed to get up early.</p><br/><p>I fumbled around looking for my phone when I felt that the blanket felt unfamiliar. My blanket didn\u2019t feel or smell this good. This blanket seemed like it had been dried under the sun yesterday.</p><br/><p>I heard young children talking outside my blanket.</p><br/><p>Ah, right. I came over to my brother\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, nuna, our uncle is a master at rolled omelets. He\u2019s really good at them1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Did you try them? They\u2019re really big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really good at Korean pancakes as well! But he doesn\u2019t make them as often now. He said it was a pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. His love for us chilled once we started elementary school.\u201d</p><br/><p>What were they doing?</p><br/><p>I took off my blanket. Four familiar heads were gathered below my bed with my phone in the center. Their milky, chubby cheeks wriggled as they continued talking.</p><br/><p>Then I heard some familiar voices mixed in with their voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kids jumped up as soon as I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle! We didn\u2019t answer it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt kept ringing so we came to turn it off thinking it was an alarm, but it was a phone call!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were going to wake you up after saying hi to the unnies! But then the talk dragged on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s four of us and four nunas so we understood each other!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what were they saying?</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat up and put my hand out. Gyeoul handed me my phone without hesitation.</p><br/><p>I was met with four pairs of eyes when I looked at the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Oppa! Open your eyes!</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung said with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are open.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was going on so early in the morning?</p><br/><p>I was blinking my dry eyes when LJ, who was next to Im Seoyoung, suddenly said.</p><br/><p>-Put something on first. We can see everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately looked down.</p><br/><p>I was wearing a grey short-sleeved shirt and shorts.</p><br/><p>-It was a joke to wake you up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m wide awake now. Thaaanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ laughed with a satisfied expression. The quadruplets were giggling as well.</p><br/><p>I put my phone away and tidied my hair a little. I picked it back up once I looked a little more presentable. The members were looking at me like meercats.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you video call me so early in the morning? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>-We couldn\u2019t contact you at all yesterday! Our schedule ended early this morning!</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung yawned after fussing about how she didn\u2019t get much sleep.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee calmly said.</p><br/><p>-When do you arrive?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be taking the 11 a.m. flight there.\u201d</p><br/><p>While answering, I examined their faces. Although it had only been a day, I wanted to check if they were doing alright. Im Seoyoung and LJ were as high-spirited as ever, and Lee Taehee was lethargic like she was out of energy.</p><br/><p>And Lee Songha\u2026</p><br/><p>Her head was peeking out from behind Im Seoyoung and LJ.</p><br/><p>Her mouth moved like she had something to say to me.</p><br/><p>-Oppa!</p><br/><p>Her one word felt like a warm breeze.</p><br/><p>-Oppa, are you going to marry before you\u2019re thirty?</p><br/><p>Accompanied by some nonsense.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>-There\u2019s not much time left. You\u2019ll be thirty in a year and a half!</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thank you for reminding me of my age. But what are you saying? Marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma said so.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice suddenly joined in from below my bed.</p><br/><p>Was this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?</p><br/><p>The quadruplets examined my mood as they spoke out,</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time, grandma said that uncle needed to marry before he becomes thirty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Mom was already hoping that a celebrity might come and sing at the ceremony!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, that uncle might marry a celebrity-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped the kids from talking. Then I looked at my phone again.</p><br/><p>As soon as our eyes met, Lee Songha said.</p><br/><p>-The trend is to marry late these days. Thirty-one or two, thirty-five\u2026 Even marrying went you\u2019re in your forties is fine. Right?</p><br/><p>The other girls each added.</p><br/><p>-Uuhh\u2026 Yeah, when people are living until they\u2019re a hundred, forty is still young!</p><br/><p>-People in our industry usually marry late.</p><br/><p>-I bet he won\u2019t be able to marry early anyways?</p><br/><p>LJ shrugged as she hammered in the last nail.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so certain? Why can\u2019t I marry early?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Just look around you.</p><br/><p>\u201cAround me?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Hyunjo oppa, single. The team leader is also single. In fact, even the CEO is single.</p><br/><p>She was oddly persuasive.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, it looked like I was single 20 years from now as well seeing as I didn\u2019t have a wedding ring on my finger. Don\u2019t tell me I really won\u2019t marry until I\u2019m over forty?</p><br/><p>When I thought about this, I suddenly laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>-Why are you laughing all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, why are you laughing?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the screen and beyond it, eight heads tilted as they looked at me.</p><br/><p>I kept laughing as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s so silly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just yesterday, it felt like I was fighting with some unknown assailant when I thought about the future.</p><br/><p>What kind of person would I be? How bad would I become? Even when my brother said those words to me, inwardly, I was frustrated, worried if it really was that easy.</p><br/><p>That was just yesterday.</p><br/><p>Yet, today, I\u2019m wondering if my future self was married or not.</p><br/><p>-Oppa, what\u2019s wrong?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha asked with a worried expression. I probably had a strange expression on my face.</p><br/><p>The others were staring at me as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. My soul felt like it was rotting.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Rotting?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but I guess I should say it feels a little cleansed now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing, I told them I would see them soon.</p><br/><p>I stretched after hanging up. Then I got to my feet.</p><br/><p>I had a lot of things to do.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s not dwell on it.</p><br/><p>If becoming a bad person was my future, then I wouldn\u2019t stay put and let it.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Using \u2018Bro\u2019 or \u2018Brother\u2019 to distinguish between \u2018Hyung\u2019</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> Xunzi \u2013 known for \u2018Human nature is bad\u2019, that we need to reform our bad nature (or so I think)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-134\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 134\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-136\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 136\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201382\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

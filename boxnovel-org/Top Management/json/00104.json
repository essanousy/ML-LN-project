Someone looked like he was recalling whether there was a similar title among the independent films he was cast in, and another person gave me an odd look, as though asking me what I was suddenly saying.</p><br/><p>Then there was the man sitting at the very back.</p><br/><p>The man who was slowly fanning himself with a wrinkled script paused.</p><br/><p>So he was.</p><br/><p>Even though it was a long time ago, I faintly remembered a scene. He gave a strong impression despite wearing a grey school uniform and having a tidy haircut that covered the tips of his ears. His arm barely managed to stretch out from a rusty grating.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. How interesting. Not a lot of people know that film because it flopped.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man said while resuming to fan himself. The wind tangled his messy hair even more. His long eyes were revealed through his hair. Like diluting water with water, his eyes were dull and tepid.</p><br/><p>I was the one who was surprised. Should I say it was like I discovered a trace from the past?</p><br/><p>\u201cI was watching a ton of movies when it released because it was just before my mandatory military service.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have good eyes. Nam Jiyoon, this guy, he didn\u2019t appear much in the film.\u201d</p><br/><p>A different man who wore a baseball cap joined in.</p><br/><p>So his name was Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t appear a lot. I remembered him as a supporting role. One who stood out more than the lead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was to my liking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I respect your tastes. If he was to your liking, then I can see why you remember him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis atmosphere. His atmosphere as an actor was to my liking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man wearing a baseball cap seemed to have a joking personality as he giggled.</p><br/><p>When I looked to my side because I felt an itch on my cheek, Kim Taewoong, this guy, was looking at me while covering his mouth. I had an ominous premonition that \u2018respecting your tastes\u2019 would be plastered in the group chat with my friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, today, to learn about your hidden preferences\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like U-turns, should I do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. I\u2019ll shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>After shutting him up, I drove down the unpaved road again.</p><br/><p>When I looked in my rear-view mirror, Nam Joyoon, seemingly unsatisfied with fanning himself, had opened the window halfway and enjoyed the breeze. Maybe it was because I first saw him on the big screen, but it felt like I was seeing him through a screen rather than in reality.</p><br/><p>What sort of projects did he work on after Pet Shop? Seeing as I didn\u2019t see him in theaters since, it seemed he was only cast in independent films.</p><br/><p>He had a unique atmosphere and his looks and body weren\u2019t bad so why didn\u2019t he become popular?</p><br/><p>While I was immersed in my thoughts about Nam Joyoon, the other actors were complaining about their companies and contracts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was in a 5-year contract, but the company did nothing for me. They didn\u2019t get me a good scenario or role. They just took a commission whenever I got a minor role after chasing down auditions. Bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig companies are absolutely better. They have a lot of connections and get a ton of scenarios.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know they are good? I just don\u2019t get scouted by them even though I can work like a bull.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompanies are companies, but you also need to get a good manager. Even though I was in a company, I had to hand out my own business cards because my manager wasn\u2019t good at business. Hearing what other people have told me, it seems like chiefs lobby to get roles for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like I was watching women chatting at the stream while doing laundry, though two of them were men. The only one who didn\u2019t join their conversation was Nam Joyoon. It seemed he wasn\u2019t interested in talking about companies as he simply enjoyed the breeze.</p><br/><p>The actors were discussing a few companies.</p><br/><p>\u201cW&amp;U doesn\u2019t seem like they are interested in discovering rookie actors, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I unconsciously let out a dry cough.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are probably busy looking at top stars and A rank actors on the free-agent market.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they are more focused on developing idols than actors these days since the profitability of developing idols is good relative to the investment. I don\u2019t like W&amp;U as much these days since it seems like they\u2019re getting greedy for money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, right. You\u2019re going to sign if they scout you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, of course, I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, W&amp;U is still virtuous. There are quite a few who they discovered and raised to A rank. Just look at Seo Jijoon, who blew up recently, and they pretty much took care of Lee Songha as a rookie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t her manager the one who took care of her, instead of the company? It seems that way when reading the articles.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had a feeling, but the actress with long hair brought me up in the end.</p><br/><p>Kim Taewoong, who was fully aware of the company I worked for, kept alternating his gaze between me and the back. Glossing over their gossip about companies, I had no intention of eavesdropping a conversation about me in real time. I was already tired of monitoring comments about me on the internet.</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to take off my sunglasses before the mood became weird\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this your first time in this industry? That\u2019s totally media manipulation. W&amp;U keep bringing him up because he does well on entertainment shows. If they package it like that, it becomes a good story and Lee Songha\u2019s image becomes better too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to give it to the W&amp;U PR Team\u2019s media manipulation skills. It\u2019s certain that Lee Songha became popular because of their manipulation than her acting. Her manager just got lucky because of them. He got to appear on shows and spread his name. Honestly speaking, what kind of amazing talent does a road manager have to make an unknown girl into a star in a few months?\u201d</p><br/><p>An actress with bobbing hair and a muscular man jeered.</p><br/><p>When I clicked my tongue and took off my sunglasses, Kim Taewoong calmly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? Bastard, how did you make an unknown celebrity into a star within a few months when you don\u2019t have any outstanding talent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I have some other talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou definitely have a talent in taking care of people. Your quadruplets are proof of that. We thought that it was a loss for the national child education industry when you became a manager. Still, I didn\u2019t think that your talent in taking care of kids could be useful in taking care of celebrities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey do have their similarities.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while grinning. Kim Taewoong looked back with a sly face. The back was quiet for a while as though someone had pressed the mute button. My face itched while they stared at me with uncertain expressions.</p><br/><p>Kim Taewoong looked back at the woman with curly hair and the muscular man and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. I shrink when I don\u2019t say what\u2019s on my mind so I have to say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPa-pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard isn\u2019t lucky because of his company, it\u2019s the opposite. His nickname there is Lucky Charm. While it\u2019s funny, the minivan you\u2019re riding in right now and his gas bill are paid by his comp-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, dammit. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Kim Taewoong shut his mouth while smiling.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt he said that to tease me, damn bastard. How did he know that my nickname was Lucky Charm? I definitely have never mentioned it before. Did some bored reporter write an article about it after hearing it?</p><br/><p>While thinking I should hit him when the opportunity arises, I looked in the rear-view mirror.</p><br/><p>Then I said to the two actors who became flustered because of Kim Taewoong,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha didn\u2019t get popular due to media manipulation. You should know if you saw her drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t say that. Hey, you\u2019re the one who said it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t see the drama\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beside me, Kim Taewoong was astonished, saying, \u201cWhy would you saw it was certain she became popular due to media manipulation if you didn\u2019t see her drama?\u201d I also clicked my tongue. I had a real headache because of Lee Songha\u2019s acting controversy that I was more sensitive to conversations like this than others.</p><br/><p>The two actors curled up and apologized.</p><br/><p>The other two, the actress with straight hair and the man with a baseball cap, looked like they were dying to ask questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really Lee Songha\u2019s, ah, Neptune\u2019s manager, right? What brings you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you came here to look for decent actors on the film set\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s for a personal reason. My friend\u2019s younger cousin is on the film set.\u201d</p><br/><p>My lips curled into an awkward smile on its own. However, the actors didn\u2019t show any signs of disappointment at my words as their eyes shined as though they knew it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then could I ask you a few questions? How do casting managers at W&amp;U obtain profiles? As expected, through agents?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you give me your business card? I might need to call you one day!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time since I was promoted to a chief, I handed out my stiff, new business cards.</p><br/><p>I answered the pouring questions the best I could. Since I didn\u2019t have an opportunity to talk with actors like this since Cat Guardian Ghost ended, I enjoyed it quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Despite this, my eyes kept wandering to one person while talking.</p><br/><p>Towards Nam Joyoon who was silently sitting in the back seat.</p><br/><p>He flipped through his wrinkled script, brushed his faded grey t-shirt, and even placed his small head against the headrest as if he enjoyed the plush seat.</p><br/><p>How strange.</p><br/><p>Why was I so concerned about him?</p><br/><p>The set of the independent film was a quiet resort with a small pond.</p><br/><p>It seemed they were finished with a shoot as the staff were bustling around quickly while carrying cameras, lights, and reflective panels. While the scale was incomparably smaller than Cat Guardian Ghost, their passion didn\u2019t lose out to them.</p><br/><p>I parked next to a truck. The woman with curly hair and the muscular man, who were uncomfortable the ride here, ran away towards the set. The other actors gave us their thanks as they got off.</p><br/><p>While Kim Taewoong was looking for his cousin, I approached Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, Mr. Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon, who was standing crookedly, turned to look at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you only film independent films since Pet Shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was pleasant.</p><br/><p>But how old was he? Since he played a high schooler role in the movie I watched before I went to military service, he would be a few years younger than me if he actually was a high schooler then. Though when comparing appearances, he looked three to four years younger than me.</p><br/><p>I was looking for questions to ask while thinking this when the man wearing a baseball cap joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy barely managed to appear on a few independent films, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was surprised. Once because he called me chief. Once more because he said that Nam Joyoon barely managed to appear on a few independent films.</p><br/><p>\u201cBarely?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter filming Pet Shop, he was caught by a truly trashy company full of trashy people. After wasting his life tied to an eight-year contract, he spent another few years with a contract cancellation lawsuit. He\u2019s thirty this year\u2026 Ha, this guy\u2019s life is frustrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for organizing my life story in 15 seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said nonchalantly. Then he said goodbye and left.</p><br/><p>I watched his figure trudge away for a while.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because I could visualize the wicked company he was tied to, he looked like he was wasting away, struggling with hardship. I could understand his dull, lukewarm atmosphere and easygoing attitude. Rather, it was sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the man wearing a baseball cap struck a conversation with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m his friend. He really is someone who loves acting. And if he didn\u2019t love it so much, he wouldn\u2019t have endured all these years and appear on independent years after all that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he not join a different company afterward?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few tried to scout him since he\u2019s good at acting and has good looks, but they all backed off after saying they wanted to sign him. Well, his filmography only consists of independent films besides Pet Shop. He also has his age. They probably thought it wouldn\u2019t work out after plugging in the numbers. If they were going to turn their backs on him, then they shouldn\u2019t have shaken up the quiet tree in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>He clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m only telling you this because you seem interested in Joyoon, that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man shrugged his shoulders and left. I looked around a few times and quickly found Nam Joyoon. He was moving the luggage with the staff. Again, as though there was a filter, only Nam Joyoon stood out.</p><br/><p>It was similar to when I first saw Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Why was this? Was I biased?</p><br/><p>If I had seen the future, one where Nam Joyoon became a successful actor or where we were joined by fate, then I could understand being so concerned, but it wasn\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>While chasing Nam Joyoon with my gaze, I decided I needed to see him act.</p><br/><p>However, before I did, I needed to settle the reason I came all the way here.</p><br/><p>After briefly greeting the film director, I sat down on a bench next to the resort. In front of me were Kim Taewoong and a woman, who introduced herself as his cousin and was staring at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut are you really a chief from W&amp;U?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dumbfounded by his cousin\u2019s doubt, Kim Taewoong said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBlockhead, don\u2019t you use the internet? His face is like his business card.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I told you not to call me a blockhead! I hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can call blockheads \u2018smartheads\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>His cousin ignored Kim Taewoong\u2019s joking words and quickly checked her phone. It seemed she searched my name as her gaze alternated between my face and my picture on her screen before smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is. Oppa, if you had a friend like him, you should have introduced me to him earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff and actors around us constantly glanced at us. Their gazes, which brushed past Kim Taewoong and his cousin, landed on me. Nine times out of ten, they started murmuring to each other afterward.</p><br/><p>Should I have put my sunglasses back on?</p><br/><p>While regretting it, I asked Kim Taewoong\u2019s cousin,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that CEO said that you should debut as a girl group first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s easier to get auditions as an idol than as a rookie actor these days, you know. Well, they said it\u2019s more like a meeting than an audition. They already have four members, and I just go in as the fifth member in charge of looks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you perhaps exceptionally good at singing or dancing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m the member in charge of looks. The center of the group.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cousin said in a very proud manner.</p><br/><p>She was pretty, she was\u2026</p><br/><p>While I was thinking about what to say first, my phone vibrated briefly in my pocket. Since I thought it was a text or a chat message, I continued talking,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c25. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you mean \u2018why\u2019? It was because I couldn\u2019t understand the CEO no matter how much I thought about it.</p><br/><p>There were more than a million celebrity aspirants in this age. The number one dream of young students was becoming a celebrity, and two million kids gathered for the preliminaries of a public broadcast audition program.</p><br/><p>Because the competition was so fierce, even young, pretty trainees who were great singers had a hard time debuting. Yet why did this CEO want a 25-year-old aspiring actress as a girl group member?</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me that the name of the company and CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cousin took out a business card. Just as I received it and began examining it, my phone began to vibrate again. It wasn\u2019t only once. Thinking it might be a call, I took out my phone only to find that they were messages.</p><br/><p>-Oppa, I\u2019m Songha. I heard that you were hit in a fight! Are you injured? Hyunjo oppa is apparently taking care of today\u2019s schedule for you, are you unable to come because you\u2019re hurt?</p><br/><p>This was the first message. The ones after came right after one another as though she was worried because I didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>-Are you really hurt?</p><br/><p>-Did you go to the hospital? Are you okay?</p><br/><p>-Oppa,</p><br/><p>There were only a few lines of text, yet I felt like I could hear Lee Songha\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>How big did the clash where we each hit each other once get for her to be so worried? Especially her last message with just \u2018oppa\u2019, that one oozed with impatience and worry. Other people might think I was in a critical condition or something.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me she thought that I fought against 17 or was in a bloody fight against someone?</p><br/><p>I first asked for Kim Taewoong and his cousin\u2019s understanding and replied back. While I was typing, Lee Songha\u2019s name appeared on my screen. This time, it was a call.</p><br/><p>A sudden video call to boot.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-103\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 103\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-105\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 105\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201321\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

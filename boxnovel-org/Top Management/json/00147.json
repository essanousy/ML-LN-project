Beside him were the director, staff, and other unknown actors who worked on the independent film with Nam Joyoon. Nam Joyoon bowed his head towards them.</p><br/><p>The staff took something out from beneath their seats.</p><br/><p>I flinched, worried it was some poster board, but fortunately, they brought out cameras. These cameras were even bigger than the reporters\u2019, but they were members of a film crew so it was to be expected. If they weren\u2019t at a theatre, they might have even brought along a film camera.</p><br/><p>I should greet them separately after the cast introductions.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, I looked at Nam Joyoon. The corners of his lips were slightly raised.</p><br/><p>As soon as the actors gathered, the project producer held the mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it must be because our actors are all amazing, but everyone seems heated in investigative spirit! After today\u2019s screening, I hope you will tell your family, friends, colleagues, and strangers about it. Now the director and cast will make their introductions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ear-piercing cheers erupted.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels weird seeing Mr. Joyoon over there, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe gets to introduce himself along with all those other top stars. Makes me feel like we\u2019ve fallen behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill he be living in a different world than us from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The independent film members whispered to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think your life will change if you appear in a couple scenes of a commercial film?\u201d</p><br/><p>A blunt voice poured cold water over their moods. It was Lee Sunghyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunghyun, did you not come to see the premiere with us before? It\u2019s not just a couple of scenes, he appears quite a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. His character is very impressionable too. With Alive\u2019s box-office results, I bet his popularity will soar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sunghyun shrugged at the director and assistant director\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how great the box-office results are. A Hollywood film is going to be released in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you cursing other\u2019s movies because your own flopped?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunsup cut in. Lee Sunghyun\u2019s expression distorted frighteningly.</p><br/><p>The assistant director quickly changed the subject when he felt the mood become dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Lee Songha, that girl has no need for lights or reflective panels. She glows on her own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer acting is even more incredible. Apparently, she filmed Alive and Royal Family at the same time, yet she got into both characters so well. They were completely different roles to boot. It like she debuted as a child actress than an idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff gaped in admiration. The audience cheered like wolves as soon as Lee Songha held the mic. Expertly introducing herself, Lee Songha looked beside her. Nam Joyoon was next. The surging cheers quickly died down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing as he\u2019s introducing himself as well, I guess he\u2019s an actor? He\u2019s good-looking compared to your average joe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish he would take his time so we have more time to look at the other actors.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she heard them, Lee Songha stopped before passing over the mic.</p><br/><p>Then she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cE-everyone, before the movie begins, please look at the person next to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>One by one, the audience looked towards Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you may not know him now, after the movie-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI know him! I know him!\u201d</p><br/><p>A pregnant woman sitting on the very front row raised her hand high.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought a ticket to this event after seeing the premiere! I even saw it early in the morning today!\u201d</p><br/><p>The excited woman stomped her feet. Receiving the mic, Nam Joyoon bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Nam Joyoon. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my goodness, you\u2019re so great at acting! My baby almost popped out while I was watching the movie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Various people in the audience laughed. A few people began taking pictures of him.</p><br/><p>The woman smiled brightly and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI became your fan, but I couldn\u2019t find a photo of you on the internet! That\u2019s why I decided to see Alive a few more times! Please appear in many movies in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>No words escaped from Nam Joyoon\u2019s mouth for a while before he bowed again.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His lukewarm expression slowly warmed.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Two hours later, the audience left the theatre in a trance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rumors weren\u2019t exaggerated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to watch it again. I was so immersed in the plot that I didn\u2019t get to look at Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was such a thrill for the whole two hours! My neck almost cramped from being tense for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience continued their positive feedback. A woman who saw the pregnant woman pass by smacked her lips in regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! I should have taken a picture of that actor too! That crazy villain, what was his name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNam\u2026 Nam Joyoon! Did I take a picture? It feels like he\u2019ll become popular, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see! Oh my gosh, the photo came out so well! Send it to me so I can post it on my blog!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing people like this, the independent film director grabbed Kim Hyunsup\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey seem to like Mr. Joyoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? Joyoon that bastard, I really hope everything goes well for him this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe suffered a ton. People like him deserve to be successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding his head, the director looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunghyun, you should stop\u2026 Huh? Where did he go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sunghyun stood rigid, pale in the face.</p><br/><p>An unknown actor sighed next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, someone\u2019s life\u2019s all set now. I always consoled myself whenever I failed an audition by thinking, \u2018At least I\u2019m better than this no-life who\u2019s been getting nowhere for the past ten years\u2019. Was Nam Joyoon also destined to be successful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sunghyun said as if convinced.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was lucky to be cast in a movie like this and was lucky to get an impactful role. If I also had this opportunity, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo shit. You would have done much better than him! I also-\u201c</p><br/><p>Just as the unknown actor put on airs, a man carrying a laptop and camera approached them and handed them his business card.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me. Could I ask you a few questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>The unknown actor asked after checking his business card,</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 Are you a reporter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came here to cover this event, but I happened to overhear your conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur conversation?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter took another step towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it seems like you\u2019re close with Mr. Nam Joyoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo! Wow, really! Holy! Wow, I can\u2019t even talk right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw the articles! Amazing! Are you really blessed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like the pied piper.</p><br/><p>Employees surrounded me in the lounge just outside my office. Their excited voices buzzed in my ears. The PR Team female employee handed me a coffee from her tray of coffee cups and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSBE Film is in a frenzy right now. Their CEO apparently said their first-week goal was 2 million people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir goal was 2 million people for the first week? Then, of course, they are in a frenzy. If I was their CEO, I\u2019d be tumbling over backwards in happiness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs 2 million people really the problem? Their opening number was 790, 000!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone shouted with a snort. Other employees were astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say it\u2019s the best yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, they\u2019ll pass their 2-million goal by tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the rumors are great right now. Wow, I\u2019m so speechless.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like my face had become a dart board. Their gazes stuck on me. The gazes, which I could have laughed off in the past, were a bit intense. So much so that I felt a little queasy. I calmly rubbed my lips to not reveal my thoughts.</p><br/><p>An Audio &amp; Recording (A&amp;R) Team female employee, who I remembered back when we were working on Neptune\u2019s mini-album, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely human just like us. You are human, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would I be if not human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how can everything you pick be jackpots? With you, won\u2019t the company not need the A&amp;R Team anymore? At this point, I think you could just pick Neptune\u2019s title track. We\u2019ll just sit back and enjoy the ride!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughter erupted in the crowd.</p><br/><p>It was a joke. Meant for a laugh. Even though I knew this, I felt like there were thorns in my throat.</p><br/><p>The moment I heard her words, the thoughts I had barely managed to suppressed burst forward. Pretty Girls. Chief Lee Taeshin. The songwriter. The song Kim Hyunjo was certain would have done better if Neptune sang it. The song that could sweep away the potential problems laying around Neptune and make my next decision a surefire success.</p><br/><p>The song destined for success. One no one else knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so loud here?\u201d</p><br/><p>A thorny voice suddenly cut through the commotion. The Team 2 Leader was walking down the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you all have no work to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employees quickly dispersed. I also simply greeted him and left. Maybe it was because of Alive\u2019s successful numbers, but the Team 2 Leader looked like an irritable stingray, and my mind was teeter-tottering as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s voice held me by the back of my neck.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you taking good care of Neptune? People have been talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s never a peaceful day. I am aware of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I was worried you threw them aside since you were so entranced by your new guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>I guess he didn\u2019t have anything to say about Nam Joyoon considering he brought up Neptune instead.</p><br/><p>I just hoped he would worry about his own work.</p><br/><p>I replied with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Rather, I feel like you can\u2019t take your eyes off me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, your words grow more revolting by the day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you need to be humble when things are going well. You never know when you\u2019ll trip up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to reply, the office door suddenly burst open.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo! Come in quickly! An article about Mr. Nam Joyoon-!\u201d</p><br/><p>The PR Team female employee flinched when she saw the Team 2 Leader.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader asked with interest,</p><br/><p>\u201cAn article? What kind of article?\u201d</p><br/><p>When we walked into the office, people were gathered around a computer.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader, Kim Hyunjo, Lee Kwanwoo, and other members of Team 3 and the PR Team were focused on the monitor. Team Leader Park was pacing around on her phone. Her voice was raised.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, it\u2019s not like Mr. Nam Joyoon\u2019s all on his own, how can you do this despite knowing he\u2019s one of us? When did you investigate all of this? If you were going to publish an exclusive, you should have mentioned it to me beforehand. How can you just suddenly throw this out there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Investigate? Exclusive article?</p><br/><p>What problems could there be regarding Nam Joyoon?</p><br/><p>Was it about his lawsuit against his previous company? But the company was more at fault.</p><br/><p>The tussle with Director Park last year?</p><br/><p>No, there was no way he could talk when he himself was guilty.</p><br/><p>I went over and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Mr. Nam Joyoon\u2019s article?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s with all this fuss?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader, who came in with me, added. He looked like he was spectating a show.</p><br/><p>Frowning, Kim Hyunjo looked at me and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be precise, it\u2019s an article about Mr. Nam Joyoon and you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBring up the article.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo moved the mouse. An article popped up on the screen.</p><br/><p>The headline and caption caught my eyes.</p><br/><p>{Chief Jung Sunwoo proves he\u2019s Midas\u2019s Hand. Not just projects, but people as well?}</p><br/><p>The actor who went unknown for ten years then suddenly became Alive\u2019s scene-stealer! Who is Nam Joyoon?</p><br/><p>What the hell?</p><br/><p>It was completely different from what I expected.</p><br/><p>As Kim Hyunjo said, the article was more about both of us than just Nam Joyoon. It included the story where we first met on the set of the independent film. Also, how he auditioned in front of Director Choi Sungwon. Shooting Alive. It was recounting of the past few months I spent with Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>It even included the part where Nam Joyoon was rejected by W&amp;U after an initial meeting.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader read a part of the article out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a call with the main reporter, a person at W&amp;U said, \u2018The team leader at the meeting commented that Nam Joyoon lacked potential,\u2019 and revealed how \u2018thinking about it now, it was the team leader, who didn\u2019t have a good eye.\u2019\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-146\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 146\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-148\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 148\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201406\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

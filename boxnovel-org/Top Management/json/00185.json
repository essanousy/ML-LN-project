So that, if an environment where it could grow without being stomped on or withered, it would sprout.</p><br/><p>Then I turned around and finally stepped forward.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you take some herbal tonic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Something touched my shoulder. Having fallen asleep against the whiteboard, I jolted awake. It was the chief of Blackout. His gaze alternated between the packed schedule on the whiteboard and my face before he clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve been infected with Hyunjo\u2019s dark circles? The Team 3 Leader knows a lot about medicinal herbs and tonics. You ask him to get you some. Like carp or loach juice or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Do you have a weak stomach? You look like the type who can eat snake raw.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m more delicate than I look. Rather than the herbal tonic, please introduce me to a hardy, good-working road manager if you know one. Ours are exhausted. We don\u2019t even have the time to recruit and train a new one.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the schedule while rolling my stiff shoulders. What caught my eye the most was Pretty Girls. They properly started their activities with IBC\u2019s music broadcast, and now their schedule was packed with autograph signing events, press interviews, guest appearances on radio and TV shows, and events.</p><br/><p>Both the Pretty Girls goldfish and Chief Lee Taeshin were getting used to their day starting and ending early in the morning. They were so happy that they should be able to work for a good while.</p><br/><p>Neptune had it worse. They had a schedule in Sangamdong early in the morning, an event in Busan at noon, and a performance in China at night. Not only did they have a busy schedule, but they also had to prepare for their official album. They were gradually becoming more and more haggard.</p><br/><p>There was nothing more to say about Lee Songha, who had her advertisement schedule on top of all that.</p><br/><p>The ones with the most free time around me were Nam Joyoon, who was thinking about his next project, and Kim Hyunsup. Although it wasn\u2019t the best for a celebrity to be too free, if Nam Joyoon had a busy schedule as well, our team would be running around with IVs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do know an experienced road manager who doesn\u2019t have any work right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackout chief said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good, hard worker. She\u2019s even pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is she? Can you give me her conta-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she can\u2019t drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it.</p><br/><p>The Blackout chief grinned when he saw my expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a joke. I do have one, but only if you\u2019re going to assign them to Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he had a condition.</p><br/><p>When I told Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader that I was looking for a manager to handle on-site schedules for Lee Songha, the news shook the entire company. There were so many fish aiming for the bait that I felt like I was an aquarist.</p><br/><p>Amongst the fish, there were road managers who had just managed to get promoted to chiefs as well as chiefs who had more experience than me. In fact, there were a few from the Team 2 who slowly approached the bait.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give me their contact information. I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, let me know if you also need their resume.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackout chief handed me their business card like he had been waiting for the opportunity. I barely managed to squeeze it into my bulging business card case. Although I wasn\u2019t fully handing her over to someone else, I felt uneasy at the thought of leaving Lee Songha under someone else\u2019s care.</p><br/><p>The chief left, and I looked back at the whiteboard. There were a few hours left before the official business I would have to handle this evening. Me having leisure time was as rare as grass in a drought. But it wasn\u2019t like I could just roll on the bed because I did.</p><br/><p>I had some unofficial business from now on.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung had the VIP room of her hair shop all to herself. I was about to go in, but I stopped. A different person was reflected in the mirror. No, it definitely was Son Chaeyoung. However, her crescent eyes and the light smile on her face, she was completely different from the Son Chaeyoung I knew.</p><br/><p>Was she someone who could make that expression when she wasn\u2019t acting?</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s expression distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She instantly returned to the Son Chaeyoung I knew. It was so quick that I almost thought I was seeing things due to sleep deprivation. I brushed aside the strong image in my mind and entered the room. I sat down on the sofa under Son Chaeyoung\u2019s sharp glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Chief Lee Janghyun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe went to look for ripe persimmons. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was still looking for that?</p><br/><p>I laughed at the ridiculousness. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s eyes burned with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to start a fight. I\u2019m watching what I say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen have I tried to start a fight? But why are you watching what you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, it did seem like her words were more awkward.</p><br/><p>More like a kindergarten teacher\u2019s, no, I couldn\u2019t compare them to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think? The public service announcement campaign is about talking properly and kindly.\u201d</p><br/><p>I went into a coughing fit.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung shooting a polite speech public service announcement. Could anything be more comedic?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I learned Korean in school!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t piss me off and leave! Your face itself provokes me!\u201d</p><br/><p>She snapped at me before turning her gaze.</p><br/><p>I stared at her. I had met with Son Chaeyoung a few times during this time. The official reason was to suggest next projects for her, but it was honestly to change the future where she retires. Because I kept feeling the \u2018intention\u2019 behind the future vision I kept seeing.</p><br/><p>However, I was making slow progress.</p><br/><p>Because Son Chaeyoung currently looked like she had no intention of retiring. Although her eyes burned with rage whenever I brought up her doing another project, she did seem like she planned on taking on new projects once she left W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>In order to change her future, I had to figure out what to change about the present, but nothing stuck out to me as I observed her like this. I\u2019ve only gotten more and more used to dealing with Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and looked at her. Her face on the mirror was huffing. Suddenly, the unfamiliar smiling face I saw just now overlapped with her face.</p><br/><p>Was that expression for her commercial as well?</p><br/><p>I recalled what Lee Songha had said. That she couldn\u2019t become like Son Chaeyoung. I didn\u2019t know if it was because of that, but I also began to wonder if Son Chaeyoung had a phase where she was like Lee Songha in the past. W&amp;U employees said that she was like this since she joined W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you keep saying my name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only said it once. But was your personality like this when you debuted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is my personality?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said truthfully. Son Chaeyoung kicked the leg of the vanity, and her chair spun twice before stopping in front of me. Son Chaeyoung crossed her legs and stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t like this when I debuted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her lips curled up into a crooked smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was like this since I was wearing diapers. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even wait for my reply and she said in a dubious manner,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you so interested in me these days? I heard that you were looking for a manager to handle Lee Songha\u2019s on-site schedules. Are you planning on handing her over completely and working with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no plans on working with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no work for you either!\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked the snorting Son Chaeyoung,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you so interested in who I manage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt first, you told me to ditch Songha and to work with you. Later, you mentioned how I looked like I had devoted myself to Songha but got pissed when you thought I accepted the CEO\u2019s proposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying this, I noticed Son Chaeyoung was frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember you clearly stating you had no thoughts on working with me. But then you would ask me to change who I manage whenever we meet. You did it just now too. Just what is it you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s pupils moved from her left to her right.</p><br/><p>She was silent for a bit like she was lost in thought, but she soon lightly shrugged,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout how long your little game of house will last.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Cheayoung once again turned her chair towards the vanity.</p><br/><p>Just then, the door burst open. Chief Lee Janghyun entered while panting like a wild boar. He seemed to have gone around a fruit market as he gave off a rather sweet scent. He didn\u2019t have to leisure to recognize me as he shouted with a red face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Chaeyoung. I can\u2019t do this any longer. The iced persimmons I got from the tea shop in Insadong the day before yesterday is the best I can do. Where would I find ripe persimmons on trees during this season?! Ms. Chaeyoung, you don\u2019t like me, do you? If you don\u2019t like me, then just say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung immediately answered.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun, who seemed to have returned his senses, stuttered,</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what part of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I list off every little thing? Just ask me what about you I like!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about me do you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun shut his mouth like a chick that ate honey. Looking so pissed she could explode, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s gaze alternated between me and Chief Lee Janghyun before she suddenly smiled brightly. Her smile really could only be described that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chills ran from my toes to the top of my head.</p><br/><p>Pointing to the door with a still smiling face, Son Chaeyoung added,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease screw off.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung told Jung Sunwoo to screw off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo asked with a smirk. He waved his hand as though urging for a response.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun, who sat next to him on the sofa in the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office, nodded his head with vigor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know Ms. Chaeyoung\u2019s temp- personality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Chaeyoung pointed to the door and told him to \u2018please screw off\u2019. I felt bad for Chief Jung, who was chased out with a red face yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun glanced in a direction while speaking with a glib tongue. The Team 2 Leader was sitting at his desk. It was a bleak atmosphere. His normally well-groomed beard now looked like prickly thorns. This calm before the storm had continued for the past few days now.</p><br/><p>Chief Jo tried his best to change the mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo, that guy, will have it tough. That\u2019s why he should have given up early on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was destined to happen since he zealously said he\u2019ll handle Ms. Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun followed Chief Jo\u2019s lead. By the time Jung Sunwoo had been thoroughly cut up and smashed around, it seemed Chief Jo\u2019s tactic worked as the Team 2 Leader\u2019s lips suddenly curled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so hot-blooded because he\u2019s young. He\u2019s impertinent because he\u2019s been on a roll. He has no respect for his seniors. Well, the CEO is protective of him, so who would he fear? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo and Chief Lee Janghyun hesitantly nodded along.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s gaze grew colder when he mentioned the CEO.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s gotten himself into such a situation without understanding his position.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice grew dark. Chief Jo flinched. Chief Lee Janghyun warmed his hands with his teacup as he looked around, reading the mood. Suddenly, the Team 2 Leader\u2019s expression fiercely distorted as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Bongjoon. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve called him over, why isn\u2019t he here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 He said that Jijoon\u2019s schedule in China might be extended.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo replied. The Team 2 Leader snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSchedule? Lee Bongjoon, that quick-witted fellow, is probably squatting there, trying to avoid the storm. I just happened to have him manage Jijoon. Jijoon used to listen to my every word back when he was a rookie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His beard squirmed as he said to Chief Jo,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jo, you pay special attention to Inho! So that he doesn\u2019t become like Jijoon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo, he\u2019s the problem. After meeting him, Lee Bongjoon and Jijoon are acting like foals released from their reins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Jijoon brought a bouquet to Chief Jung\u2019s party not long ago. It looks like he might transfer over if Chief Jung makes his own team\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun stopped talking. Chief Jo was pinching his side. The Team 2 Leader glared at him like he would personally choke him to death.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he recalled the embarrassment he experienced in front of others that day as the veins on the Team 2 Leader\u2019s clenched fist bulged. His complexion turned red.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s sharp gaze landed on a section of his desk. It was a framed group picture of actors in W&amp;U. Seo Jijoon was smiling off to the side in the photo that the Team 2 Leader looked at with satisfaction whenever he had time.</p><br/><p>\u201cJijoon\u2019s mine. I brought him up since he was a rookie. He\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Jijoon\u2019s the product of your effort. All Jung Sunwoo did was connect him to Cat Guardian Ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo agreed by clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, the projects you were considering for Jijoon that time were all successes. Jijoon would probably be as successful as he is now if he had just followed the filmography you were building for him? Although I don\u2019t know how Jung Sunwoo was able to befriend him so quickly, he shouldn\u2019t try to stab you in the back by bringing Jijoon with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, he can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo has only had it easy until now, so it seems like he has no idea how disgusting it feels to be stabbed in the back. If he doesn\u2019t know, I should teach him. He\u2019ll learn something when he loses the actor he trusts and holds dear.\u201d</p><br/><p>The actor Jung Sunwoo trusts and holds dear?</p><br/><p>Chief Jo, who had been going along with him, made a face,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha? Team leader, she\u2019s not the type to-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cBetray Jung Sunwoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader made a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what can split apart a close relationship between a celebrity and her manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader shook his head. Just as he was about to open his mouth to speak, he looked at Chief Lee Janghyun. Chief Lee Janghyun, who was dawdling to listen further, was soon pushed out the office. Only the Team 2 Leader and Chief Jo remained in the office.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo\u2019s eyes widened. The Team 2 Leader leaned against his chair as he continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the manager\u2019s opinion clashes with her family\u2019s and their relationship becomes stormy, the celebrity stuck in the middle will side with their family in the end. No matter how good or bad their relationship with their family is, blood is thicker than water. Feeling betrayed, the manager will eventually become a stranger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Making a crooked smile, the Team 2 Leader said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I should have a talk with Lee Songha\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Hearing the elevator\u2019s ring, I opened my eyes. What was left of my vigor was sapped during our production meeting. My brain shouted how it would go on strike if I didn\u2019t immediately slump over and sleep. I was about to enter my office while rubbing my temples when I heard\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader! Team Leader Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun, who wandered around the lounge anxiously, rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the Team 2 Leader and Chief Jo talk. I had qualms about their conversation and decided that I needed to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked around while speaking. He reminded me of a mouse every time I saw him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s regarding Ms. Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>My mind jolted awake.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun led me to the stairs like this was some spy action flick. He checked above and below the stairs before approaching me. He then said in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I really want to manage Ms. Lee Songha. Even if it\u2019s temporary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say there was a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is. The Team 2 Leader wants to sta-, so he wants to do something about Ms. Lee Songha. But you know the Team 2 Leader\u2019s personality, right? I\u2019m dead if I get caught telling you this. I really am taking a big risk here.\u201d</p><br/><p>What about Lee Songha?</p><br/><p>I unconsciously frowned. Chief Lee Janghyun chattered on about how he was helping me out while spit sputtered from his lips. I down at him and made a business smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it so tell me. What did the Team 2 Leader say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun got to the point. He recounted what the Team 2 Leader had said.</p><br/><p>I felt my accumulated exhaustion turned into rage. Even my mind became hot.</p><br/><p>This man\u2026</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished talking, I went down the stairs. Taken aback, Chief Lee Janghyun followed after me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-184\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 184\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-186\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 186\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201483\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

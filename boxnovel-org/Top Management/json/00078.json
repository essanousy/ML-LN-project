Im Seoyoung\u2019s round forehead hit my palm instead and bounced off. Then, before I even had time to catch her, she fell onto the floor.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung\u2019s face was scrunched up as though she was so sad she could die.</p><br/><p>I inwardly clicked my tongue as I gave her my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy bully your perfectly fine forehead? Do you want to go to the emergency instead of the studio?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNooooo. Eung.\u201d</p><br/><p>She faltered as she got up. It seemed she still wanted to be on the show. As though she barely managed to contain her tears, she bit her lips and sniffed her nose.</p><br/><p>She waited so much for this opportunity, but it seemed like pessimistic thoughts flooded her mind now that the opportunity was in front of her. Creating an obsession that she had to do well and an uneasiness of what if she didn\u2019t. As well as the fear that she might disappoint her colleagues who believed in her.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop digging yourself into a hole and think about it calmly. Just because others call you the \u2018girl breadwinner, girl breadwinner<sup>{1}</sup>\u2019, do you really think you are one? The chief or the other girls, they won\u2019t be disappointed that you couldn\u2019t get more screen time. Instead, they\u2019ll probably freak out if they knew that you were thinking this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said it as gently as I could since it seemed her mind had turned into mush.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re a genius who sweeps through all the entertainment shows you going on? Just think of it as throwing your hat into the ring of public network entertainment shows. Also, let\u2019s be honest. Do you think the one to cause an incident will be you or me today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung looked up at me with wet eyes and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, how are you so okay? You\u2019re not even a celebrity. Aren\u2019t you scared about your first recording?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. Completely okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019ll be honest, only half my brain\u2019s been working since yesterday. I\u2019m regretting that I didn\u2019t take a cheongsimhwan<sup>{2}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this while sighing, Im Seoyoung replied with smiling eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I secretly took a cheongsimhwan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ate one by yourself? If you have good stuff like that, then you should share.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you were fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung lightly tapped my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I have one more. I brought another just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she really did take out a cheongsimhwan from her bag. I laughed in surprise, but she unwrapped then handed it to me. I didn\u2019t reject and swallowed it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. Let\u2019s do this somehow with the help of the medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, oppa, just, just in case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you say that today will go well just once? Hmm? You said it would go well and Songha\u2019s drama went well and so did the incident with Taehee unni\u2019s song. I easily believe in stuff like that. I want to grab the tail of the lucky snak-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, today will go well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t see the future and because I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t be certain, but I still said it.</p><br/><p>Tears dangling on her eyelashes, Im Seoyoung smiled broadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if you smile after crying-\u201c<sup>{3}</sup></p><br/><p>I stopped what I was saying. Hmm, it wasn\u2019t proper to say that to a fully-grown woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell I cried?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuah, what do I do? I can\u2019t let them notice. What should I say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say you hit your head on the door while practicing your talents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?! That makes me seem like a dummy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s new about that? You\u2019re the one who said that you were a stupid dummy.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said this while smiling, Im Seoyoung rattled on about something while slapping my arm. Although it wasn\u2019t like the pressure had completely disappeared, fortunately, it looked like her tears had gone away.</p><br/><p>Really. I didn\u2019t think I could ever get used to comforting someone when they were crying.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this, the tips of my fingers touched thin strands of hair. I jolted to my senses. It seemed the habit I had around the quadruplets arose as my hand was on Im Seoyoung\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry. I thought of my brother\u2019s kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What about it? Why are you sorry? I\u2019m fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWomen don\u2019t like their head being pet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she lowered her head slightly. Her eyes had, at some point, curved into crescent moons.</p><br/><p>I placed my hand on her head once again.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was the effect of the cheongsimhwan or because of animal therapy, but my heart relaxed gently.</p><br/><p>As soon as we left the waiting room, we encountered Kim Hyunjo and the other girls. It seemed they had enough of waiting and had come to get us.</p><br/><p>Without a trace of having been digging herself into a hole, Im Seoyoung, mixing amidst the girls, lied naturally that she had hit her head on the door and cried because it hurt so much. Though, it didn\u2019t seem like anyone believed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Will she be okay?\u2019 Kim Hyunjo mouthed to me.</p><br/><p>I silently nodded.</p><br/><p>Then, not long after, we all stepped onto the studio set.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>10:35 a.m. A spacious VIP dressing room.</p><br/><p>Producer Yoon, who gave a gaunt, rigid impression, and Writer Park, who was experienced in the public network entertainment scene as a main writer for ten years, both of them were flipping through each cue card as they explained the rules.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Im Seoyoung of Neptune apparently went on a few entertainment shows. So when you pass the conversation over to them, it\u2019ll be good to pass it over to her to prevent any trouble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t receive the conversation properly when I pass it to them a few times, then I\u2019m not going to talk to them,\u201d</p><br/><p>Said one of the MCs, Park Taepyeong, a comedian who debuted with IBC and was known for his irritable character. Hong Sukwoo, the other MC, who debuted as an anchor and had been leisurely eating an energy bar, replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said they are rookies. Hyung, are you going to step and kill them before they can even grow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying if they can\u2019t when I pass the conversation to them, if! When the cast is so large, are we going to teach those who can\u2019t even follow up on a conversation? Is this a school? If they can\u2019t even do that, then tell them to go on a cultural program and just read the script!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, this is why all our juniors find it hard to approach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI care about those who do well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Park, who had been listening to their conversation, smiled as she cut in,</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Glossing over the celebrities, please pay attention to the managers. They are just normal people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoon lowered his head as he requested,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although we did pick those who should be good on air, you know it too. If we place normal people in front of a camera, no matter how great of a talker they are, they can\u2019t show their full ability. If seniors don\u2019t save them, our broadcast will flop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell doctors to save them. Well, are there any decent people?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Park Taepyeong\u2019s reply, Producer Yoon licked his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Hyunjong\u2019s manager has a sense for it since he\u2019s been on air a few times. Jang Noksu\u2019s manager was someone who used to be an aspiring comedian. Also, Neptune\u2019s manager has a few stories about Lee Songha so we\u2019re keeping an eye on him as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, we see celebrities on air all the time. If we want to beat out other network\u2019s Lunar New Year\u2019s specials, then there needs to be a gem amongst the managers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Taepyeong clicked his tongue as he flipped through the managers\u2019 profiles.</p><br/><p>Hong Sukwoo smiled as he added,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look for one. A gem.\u201d</p><br/><p>10:55 a.m. 10 minutes before the recording.</p><br/><p>The lights poured onto the set like the scorching summer sun.</p><br/><p>In the middle were seats for the two MCs, and stands fanned out from either side. On one side were gorgeous celebrities and on the other sat managers with name tags on their chests.</p><br/><p>A young, female producer explained in front of the clearly nervous managers,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re not a live show, you can speak with ease. As you all have mics on, the audio will pick up everything you say so no going off on tangents. Also, the writers are going to be continuously writing instructions so constantly watch them through the corner of your eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, understood! I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Noksu\u2019s manager, Kim Dongho, shouted in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do as you did in the prior interviews, Chief Kim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The beef set will be mine and Noksu\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression was different from any other manager. The tenser other managers looked, the more composed his expression became. That was obvious since he was confident he would be stand out the most among them.</p><br/><p>As soon as the producer stepped off the set, the managers began to talk with people next to them. Sitting at the end, Kim Dongho was cursing the producer who had guided them as he glanced to the person next to him.</p><br/><p>Neptune\u2019s manager. Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the type of person Kim Dongho liked.</p><br/><p>First, he was taller than him, and on top of that, he looked quite distinguished because he was from a big company. Also, he looked very much at ease as he sat with his legs crossed and was waving to Neptune on the other side.</p><br/><p>Why was this person so carefree? Was he a team leader?</p><br/><p>Inwardly complaining, Kim Dongho started a conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, hello. You\u2019re sitting next to me so I hope you can provide good reactions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Although I\u2019m not going to.\u2019 He swallowed this thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. Please take care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo greeted him. Kim Dongho frowned subtly. Although he didn\u2019t look like he would be disliked by the viewers, he still wasn\u2019t likable. However, after listening to his voice, the scales tipped more towards being \u2018likable\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come on the show? If it\u2019s Neptune, ah, is it to help the rookies grow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you must be going through a lot, being assigned to rookies. I was cast before this program was proposed. I used to be an aspiring comedian. Though, I\u2019m a manager because I wasn\u2019t lucky. My dream is still to become a broadcaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you must not be worried about today\u2019s recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a program meant for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trying his best not to sound arrogant, Kim Dongho continued to speak,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, as someone who\u2019s worked in this industry for 6 years, what is there to be nervous of? Other people should have also been working for a few years now so I don\u2019t know why they are so nervous. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very experienced. I ate a cheongsimhwan before I came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really? You don\u2019t look inexperienced. How long have you been working?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c4 months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Dongho blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not as Neptune\u2019s manager, in total.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It has been 4 months since I\u2019ve started working.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Dongho ridiculed himself for having been wary of him.</p><br/><p>He was only for display.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>11 a.m. They began.</p><br/><p>The studio, which had been bustling with dozens of staff and involved parties, became silent. The faces of the celebrities in front of me and the managers around me changed. I could even feel a prickling sense of tension.</p><br/><p>The two MCs, who would appear whenever you turned on the TV, skillfully progressed with the opening.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Neptune didn\u2019t look very nervous. Even Im Seoyoung, although she was still a little stiff in the shoulders, she was much better than before. It seemed the MCs looked at them favorably as Neptune\u2019s introduction was longer than others.</p><br/><p>The problem was this side. The managers.</p><br/><p>The phrase \u2018general crisis\u2019 was meant for situations like this. Every time an MC talked to them, there would be silence for a few seconds. Also, over half of them would stutter or say some nonsense. I felt that the producers would have a stomach full of frustration when they went to edit it later.</p><br/><p>There was only so many times the MCs could gloss over it with jokes, Park Taepyeong looked like he was about to throw the cue cards at us a few times now. Even the faces of the producers and writers were becoming gloomy.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t nice to say it was thanks to them, seeing the managers messing up made my heart more steadfast. Should I say it was learning from others\u2019 faults? My parents and relatives would be watching this, maybe my entire family would gather to watch this, so I couldn\u2019t show myself acting like them.</p><br/><p>I thought my self-introduction went well since Kim Hyunjo\u2019s expression was good when I looked at him from the side.</p><br/><p>After the introductions of the cast and a light talk about their private lives ended, the MCs placed a toy-like object on top of each manager\u2019s table. It was semi-circular and was barely big enough to fit on a person\u2019s hand. On top of it were grooves for fingers.</p><br/><p>I thought I saw something like this somewhere.</p><br/><p>The MCs mischievously said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, managers, put your hands on top of those devices!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose viewing the broadcast probably know this, but these are portable lie detectors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lie detectors?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, we need only the truth to come from managers\u2019 mouths. But because the relationship between a manager and celebrity could be unhealthy or maybe because they are aware of their company CEO, they might unconsciously lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we prepared this. Since the device will shock you if you lie, you will have no choice, and I emphasize this because it\u2019s important, you will have no choice but to tell the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Murmurs erupted around me.</p><br/><p>I carefully placed my hand on top of the lie detector.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because I had so many things that could be considered secret, but this small device felt like a bomb to me.</p><br/><p>The truth, huh?</p><br/><p>What would the MCs ask me? There wasn\u2019t anything that could be considered a lie in the lines I prepared beforehand. Also, even if it was a lie detector, it wouldn\u2019t be as precise as those that appear in dramas since it seemed like they were doing this as a joke.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 There wouldn\u2019t be any trouble, right?</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1} </sup>Refers to younger members being the breadwinner of their household (or in this case, Neptune).</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> Pills that relax one\u2019s heart. Sort of like anxiety pills.</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> \u2018If you laugh after crying, you\u2019ll grow a horn on your butt.\u2019</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-77\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 77\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-79\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 79\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201269\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

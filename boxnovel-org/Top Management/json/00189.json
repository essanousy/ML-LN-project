Who\u2019s really hot in our company right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha. And them, Pretty Girls. Should we ask Mr. Sunwoo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The female PR employee trailed off. The Team 2 Leader, who was sitting at the seat of honor, frowned. As soon as she mentioned Jung Sunwoo\u2019s name, the heated mood of the room cooled. The Team 2 Leader gestured to Chief Jo Byunghwan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet Inho and Jijoon together for dinner and take a picture.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJijoon is great. I\u2019ll let a few reporters now so that they publish articles right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park of the PR Team settled the matter with a smile. Then she handed him an envelope.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe amount of buzz around \u2018Love Again\u2019 increased drastically over the week.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her pen pointed at the SNS buzz monitoring graph. It was the result of analyzing specific keywords. The gazes of the Team 2 Leader, Chief Jo Byunghwan, and a few Team 2 and PR Team employees landed on the increasing graph.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader rubbed his beard and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it compared to Alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlive had a ton of top stars. It had an extravagant cast and was a blockbuster, while Love Again is a melodrama, no matter how good the director is. We can\u2019t really compare the two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what if we compare Nam Joyoon and Inho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park frowned. Gazes were exchanged multiple times in the quiet office. The Team 2 Leader and Song Inho and Jung Sunwoo and Nam Joyoon. Their relationship was well-known amongst W&amp;U employees.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon had proved himself to be a rising star in Chungmuro and Jung Sunwoo confirmed his discerning eye, so all that remained as the Team 2 Leader and Song Inho\u2019s results. The company was as interested in Song Inho\u2019s debut as Love Again\u2019s success.</p><br/><p>Would the Team 2 Leader be able to regain face after losing it thanks to a rookie?</p><br/><p>Or would he be dealt a fatal blow after confirming he didn\u2019t possess a good eye?</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader waited for Team Leader Park\u2019s reply in a leisurely manner. Rubbing the tip of her pen and tapping her tablet with her other hand, Team Leader Park said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Joyoon was quiet until the preview. SBE Film hid him like it was a blind marketing strategy. We poured a lot of work into promoting Inho even before the preview. He went on interviews, production briefing sessions, and promotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We can\u2019t compare them too. The buzz around Inho is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park sighed as she showed him an increasing graph.</p><br/><p>As if he had been waiting for those words, the Team 2 Leader smiled in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>The male PR Team employee pressed a button. The elevator was stopped in the basement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Team 2 Leader is really concerned about Mr. Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be exact, he\u2019s more concerned about Mr. Sunwoo than Mr. Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee added after looking around. The male employee tapped the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like Mr. Sunwoo\u2019s going to lose at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Alive was a huge hit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to look at the movie and actor separately. It\u2019s not like that movie was a huge hit because of Mr. Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, you have to consider that Mr. Joyoon played a big role in drawing in the audience early on! His acting skills were recognized by the public, and his filmography now contains a movie with over ten million viewers. From a completely unknown actor to\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Song Inho\u2019s reception is just as good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee opened and closed her mouth at the male employee\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the actors on their own. You saw the movie. Song Inho\u2019s not bad at acting himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He was good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis character was good too. Outwardly, a kind rich young master, but inwardly, an emotionally deprived, rebellious youth. He gives off a sad feeling because he\u2019s not the lead. He\u2019s in a lot of scenes, and it seems like the director put his all into making his role charming over the male lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough they were aiming for it, they did manage to pull it off.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee\u2019s voice grew quieter. The male employee gestured to his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, Song Inho has this, his face. He\u2019s garnering a ton of attention on social media because of his face. He would probably have a huge fandom if he was an idol. If we look at marketable qualities, he\u2019s better than Mr. Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male employee added while licking his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019ll become a huge star as long as he\u2019s lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Nam Joyoon\u2019s good too! He\u2019s sexy and has that dangerous charm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male employee tapped his tablet and showed her the screen. Song Inho\u2019s profile picture filled the screen. As soon as she saw his refreshing face, smiling with a straw hat on his face, her cheeks flushed. Her unconsciously opened lips let out a hot breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cEurrrg, how is he so good-looking. No, still, he\u2019s too much of a younger brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The door slid open. The female employee flinched after taking a step in the elevator. Someone was already standing against the wall. Arms crossed and head down. They could see his calm face under his ruffled hair. He gave off a bleak feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cInho, did you come to see the team leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee flinched again. Team Leader Park was standing behind them at some point. Seeming to have finally noticed the people in front of him, Song Inho uncrossed his arms and came out of the elevator. On his face was the same bright smile that was on his profile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he told me to come up now that the meeting was over. How are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. People\u2019s reactions about you are so good, it makes working worthwhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy parents are also very happy. Please continue to take care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After bowing deeply to Team Leader Park and her employees, Song Inho headed towards the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office. His smile quickly faded in a few steps. His face grew dreary once more.</p><br/><p>The female employee blankly looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing him like that. He would always have a bright smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t he supposed to be excited right now? Why is he so depressed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The male employee tilted his head.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems what\u2019s accumulated is about to explode.\u201d</p><br/><p>He barged in the Team 2 Leader\u2019s office without knocking. The Team 2 Leader, who initially frowned, immediately relaxed. Song Inho quickly walked over to him. He glanced at Chief Jo Byunghwan, who was sitting on the sofa, before walking in front of the Team 2 Leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, am I doing an interview on Entertainment Plus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That has the highest ratings amongst entertainment news programs, so of course, you have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the male and female leads were supposed to do that. They had already set everything up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI called the producer there. They\u2019re going to change the setup and add you in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader said as though it was a non-issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told him to focus on you, so be prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood in the office instantly grew tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do it? Do you think that program is something a rookie actor can get on just because he wants to? I gave them information on Jijoon\u2019s next project to get you on, but why can\u2019t you do it? Once they set everything up, you just need to memorize your lines and smile in front of the camera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I suddenly join in, the screen time for the leads drop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you concern yourself with that? This is common..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even look at Imyeong sunbae\u2019s face anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Imyeong. He was the male lead of Love Again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, Lee Imyeong\u2019s screen time got reduced drastically because of Inho. A lot of the scenes Lee Imyeong shot were edited out as well. Because the movie was so different from the scenario, his expression wasn\u2019t very good after seeing the final edited version at the preview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo is he trying to start something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not doing it outright because there were a lot of eyes, but we are on the same bus when we go on promotional events. Because the male lead is frowning, the mood isn\u2019t all that great. Inho\u2019s a rookie, so of course, he going to be concerned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all good besides that soft personality of yours. You need to fix that. If you concern yourself with every little thing, you won\u2019t be able to work in this industry. If there are people in the spotlight, there are those that are not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that spotlight using underhanded methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho said in a hoarse voice. Chief Jo Byunghwan hastily examined the Team 2 Leader\u2019s complexion. The Team 2 Leader got up from his chair and glared at Song Inho. He looked like he barely managing to keep his anger in as the veins on his neck bulged.</p><br/><p>After taking two breaths, the Team 2 Leader deliberately tried to comfort him,</p><br/><p>\u201cOther guys beg me to promote them. Also, those without talent will never be able to succeed even if the company runs dry. Getting in, increasing your screen time, and making it was all you. The director was impressed with your acting and analysis of your character, so he reduced Lee Imyeong\u2019s parts and increased yours. You need to be happy when you get an opportunity like this. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Inho bit his lips. Blood flowed into his flawless lips.</p><br/><p>The back of the Team 2 Leader\u2019s hand quickly shot forward and tapped Song Inho\u2019s chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bite. You\u2019re going to injure your lip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only acting like this because it\u2019s your first time in a situation like this. Jijoon was the same. You\u2019ll quickly get used to it. So stop with the useless talk and prepare for the Entertainment Plus interview. Right, we\u2019re going to take a picture of you and Jijoon for a social media post this evening, so tidy your hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Inho. Let\u2019s go to the hair shop for a change of pace. Do you want anything to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo Byunghwan gently rubbed Song Inho\u2019s back. Son Inho\u2019s gaze alternated between the Team 2 Leader and Chief Jo Byunghwan before biting his lips again. His face distorted. The Team 2 Leader was about to say something when a knock broke the mood.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader shouted in an irritated voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, It\u2019s me, Lee Bongjoon. I\u2019ll come back at another time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the door slowly cracked open. Chief Lee Bongjoon, who had fattened up since going to China, perhaps having had gone on a restaurant spree, walked into the office. His face was that of a baby pig being dragged to the slaughterhouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, um, I heard you were looking for me. If you\u2019re busy, I can come\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Bongjoon, did you read the scripts I sent you or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did read them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you read them, then you should have replied right away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look over them with Jijoon a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s face grew ugly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, I\u2019ve been unhappy with your actions recently, but are you now completely taking after Jung Sunwoo? Or do you want Jijoon to become like Chaeyoung? We\u2019ve already looked at each one very carefully before sending them to you, so how long are you going to examine them?! Are you not going to get Jijoon to work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something we need to carefully consider, so I\u2019ll discuss it with Jijoon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s stalling, then you should coax him and make a decision!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon stuck to the door at the Team 2 Leader\u2019s shout. Then he was pushed aside. Seo Jijoon\u2019s face suddenly appeared from the abruptly opened door. He glanced at the office with narrowed eyes. Then he smiled and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, I\u2019ll look over the projects a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJijoon, you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t do one like a certain someone. I just haven\u2019t found one that I really like. Sorry. I\u2019ll make a decision as soon as possible and let you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>He bowed then pulled Chief Lee Bongjoon, who was still standing awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, let\u2019s go read the scripts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo first. I\u2019m talking with the team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I get nervous if I go around on my own. I think I have airport disorder.\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s panic disorder. Panic disorder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon looked like he was refusing but was being pulled out by Seo Jijoon, who was much thinner than him. He said goodbye to the Team 2 Leader before shutting the door. He left ten times more quickly than he came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-th-that\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader\u2019s face reddened as he even stuttered his words. It looked like sparks would fly out at any moment. Chief Jo Byunghwan looked like he was trying to leave with Song Inho. However, Song Inho\u2019s gaze was fixed on the firmly shut door.</p><br/><p>His eyes quietly flared up.</p><br/><p>After persuading Song Inho then sending him off, the Team 2 Leader shot Chief Jo Byunghwan a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long are you going to let him be? I told you to talk to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having failed to escape with Song Inho, Chief Jo Byunghwan\u2019s head was drenched in sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis personality is the problem\u2026 Chaeyoung never made a fuss about things like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has no flaws besides that temper of hers. Her not working is also a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader flopped on his chair as he clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>As though he had found something to brighten the Team 2 Leader\u2019s mood, Chief Jo Byunghwan said with a brightened face,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, but I heard that Jung Sunwoo has been constantly going over to Chaeyoung\u2019s house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe still hasn\u2019t given up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what Chief Lee Janghyun said, the mood is getting even bloodier.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mood seemed to have brightened at the news as the Team 2 Leader smirked,</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolish bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you not regret it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I took a sip of grapefruit juice. It was tart and bitter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether I regret it or not, that\u2019s my problem so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put up with what I can, but I\u2019ll handle it if it\u2019s too excessive. What\u2019s important is that there is a clear exchange between us. I am using you, and you are using me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung smiled at my reply. Her lips, which were red even without makeup, curled upwards. It was a cunning smile. That moment, I was very concerned that I was making a similar smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go tell them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung raised her glass of grapefruit juice. Then she clinked it against mine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Son Chaeyoung will do a new project.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Seo Jijoon said \uacf5\ud56d\uc7a5\uc560 instead of\uacf5\ud669\uc7a5\uc560. Quite similar, but completely different words.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-188\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 188\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-190\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 190\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201492\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

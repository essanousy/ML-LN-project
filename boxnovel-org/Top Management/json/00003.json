I can\u2019t let all my preparations go to waste.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother is 10 years older than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo sighed as he heard my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the youngest by a large age gap. Being the youngest with such a large age difference, you must have gotten pretty spoiled growing up. Then this kind of work would be hard for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a common misconception.</p><br/><p>You must have been well-cared for. Everyone must have spoiled you. I can tell you\u2019re the young master type just by looking at you. You probably don\u2019t have any guts.</p><br/><p>Comments like these. I had heard plenty of them in the army.</p><br/><p>However, I found this unfair.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother married when I was in middle school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe following year, when my sister-in-law went to the pregnancy clinic, they found out that she was pregnant with quadruplets. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I still remembered the day our lives were flipped upside down. It was hard to tell if my brother, who was always quiet and dull as dried fish, was laughing or crying.</p><br/><p>Mother, father, they said quadruplets. Hahahaha\u2026 ha\u2026</p><br/><p>Hyunjo and Gunyoung looked at me with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy sister-in-law was planning on quitting her job to focus on the baby, however with four babies, she couldn\u2019t quit. They needed both of their incomes to barely cover the cost of baby formula.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s true. With four kids, just the cost of diapers and formulas would be incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo eventually, the babies were left with my mother, but she was unable to take care of them by herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I ended up helping out. During middle school, I spent my time changing their diapers and soothing them, during high school and university, I was pretty much a constant babysitter. Because my body constantly smelled of baby formula, my nickname was once \u2018JungJumma[1]\u2019. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true that I am the youngest, but I didn\u2019t grow up with that sort of treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaah\u2026 You must have had to endure quite a lot. If you raised four kids, taking care of the members of a girl group must be nothing to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as planned.</p><br/><p>With this, I was able to avoid the bad first impression I had in my dream. In some ways, it was a relief. If I didn\u2019t have that dream, the only thing on my mind right now would have been, \u2018girl group? I\u2019m screwed, screwed, so screwed, what do I do?\u2019</p><br/><p>But I really was screwed.</p><br/><p>I was still shocked and dazed by the fact I was assigned to a girl group. However, I couldn\u2019t just quit because I was unhappy.</p><br/><p>W&amp;U was the best out of all the companies I applied to.</p><br/><p>Compared to other companies, the salary was good and there was much to learn from the way they tried to develop themselves in a foreign market while accounting for failure.</p><br/><p>Above all, their system for promotions for road managers was much more systematic and stable. This was the biggest advantage. In those hit-or-miss companies, there were rumors that managers might simply drive for several years without a promotion.</p><br/><p>There was no guarantee that if I quit, I would be able to find a better job and since it was already decided, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to check out the music and entertainment fields beforehand. Many actors would end up appearing on entertainment shows anyways. While assigned to the girl group, I could gain experience and there may be a chance to get assigned to an actor later on.</p><br/><p>Might\u2026 damn it.</p><br/><p>I picked up the profiles for Neptune.</p><br/><p>Girl group. The unfamiliar pronunciation rolled off my tongue. The girl groups I knew were the incredibly famous ones or the ones I saw in the army. Besides those, I knew of the few that appeared in various movies or dramas.</p><br/><p>Among those, there were none named Neptune.</p><br/><p>Neptune.</p><br/><p>After the boy group, Blackout, jumped straight to stardom, this was the second idol group W&amp;U put their heart and soul into. A 4-member girl group. They had debuted 2 years ago.</p><br/><p>The members each had the appearance to be responsible for the visual of the group.</p><br/><p>Looking at their profile pictures, they were all beauties who each had their own unique charm. I tried to look to see if I had ever seen any of them before, but it would only tire my eyes. After carefully reading the last page, I shoved the profile into my bag.</p><br/><p>I thought about my dream again.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, could a lucid dream be used so splendidly? It was not like I was possessed by a spirit. Even if we say I somehow got the part about getting assigned to a girl group right, wasn\u2019t it too chilling for me to get their debut year as well as the name right?</p><br/><p>Wait. Could it be?</p><br/><p>While I was searching articles related to W&amp;U. I could have skimmed by a girl group named Neptune and their debut year.</p><br/><p>I might not have remembered it, perhaps it was lodged in my subconscious and manifested in my dream. At least it was more believable than a lucid dream.</p><br/><p>Although looking at the successful future self, it wouldn\u2019t be bad if it was a lucid dream\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, did you finish reading the profile?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I read it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>After selling out my brother\u2019s quadruplets, Hyunjo\u2019s tone became softer.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur management team 3 is the hardest team in W&amp;U. Physically, mentally and emotionally. If you work someone for a while here, you can tell. That guy is going to last, that other guy is going to quit.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the mood became more serious, I sat up properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the new recruits have big dreams of becoming the CEO of a major company, what a load of bull, out of ten, seven or eight will quit within a year. The ones at the top may be like, \u2018Kids these days don\u2019t even have the basics\u2019 or \u2018Back in my day, it was much harder\u2019\u2026 however, it makes sense. These days, almost everyone joins after they have graduated university. Did I study all those years to become a driver for young girls and get them kimbab[2]? Why wouldn\u2019t they think that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou earn a small salary while your health degrades as you aren\u2019t able to properly take care of yourself. On top of that, there is a countless number of people who like to flaunt their position. We\u2019re constantly stuck lowering our heads, politely addressing them as Producer, Writer and Director. You definitely think about quitting a least a few times a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gunyoung and I blankly listened to his words.</p><br/><p>Was he implying that it is hard to succeed in this line of work so to just quit now?</p><br/><p>I did apply since I really wanted to work in this industry. It wasn\u2019t like I just recklessly decided to follow my fantasies. There wasn\u2019t anyone who didn\u2019t know that the job of a manager was tough. I also heard that the entertainment industry was a cheap and dirty place to work.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why I am telling you both this?\u201d</p><br/><p>We read each other\u2019s eyes and answered differently.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re our senior, so you wanted to give us advice\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we need to know the reality before we face\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to quit, quit early.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I become if you quit after I train you both. I need to recruit new employees and train them again. So if you don\u2019t think you can keep up, quit even a day earlier and go your own path. Don\u2019t stay uncertain for 2 weeks or a month and make me more tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wow. This was my first day.</p><br/><p>I hope not all new employees have to hear this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to stay, do a good job, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t even started work and I was already exhausted. My chest felt stuffy as if a heavy rock was inside it. We didn\u2019t speak a word while driving for 5 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here, it\u2019s that small apartment.\u201d</p><br/><p>The van stopped in front of the apartment. I thought that there would be something special about an idol\u2019s residence, but there wasn\u2019t much.</p><br/><p>Gunyoung commented while getting out of the van.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very different from Blackout\u2019s residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t compare them. They have obsessive stalkers. If they were to live in a place like this with a shabby security system, it would be chaotic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 Stalkers are quite scary these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey give me goosebumps. One time, someone told me that when they came home after work, they found a fan in their closet. There are plenty of psychos.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess Neptune doesn\u2019t have any fans like those?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t. How could they have stalkers when they don\u2019t even have regular ones. However, even after they become popular, girl groups don\u2019t have as much of a hard time as boy groups because of stalkers. There are occasionally some crazy bastards that run over to touch them during a signing event or celebratory events. Perverted bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo loathingly entered the apartment. Gunyoung and I closely followed behind.</p><br/><p>Our eyes met as I looked to the side. I felt a hint of both awkwardness and comradery. We laughed at the same time. The dimples on Gunyoung\u2019s cheek became more pronounced. I felt the same way the first time we met, but I feel like he has a great personality. I wondered what was his impression of me. I hoped I was at least not a jackass in his eyes.</p><br/><p>I stuck my hand out first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am 27.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So am I. \u201908 graduate. Should we talk casually since we\u2019re the same age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I would have to get to know him more, but I felt that he wasn\u2019t such a bad guy.</p><br/><p>We took the elevator and went up to the fifth floor. Hyunjo didn\u2019t even knock and entered the passcode on the door[3].</p><br/><p>Click.</p><br/><p>The hallway was still dark. After struggling to take off my shoes, I entered. Maybe it was because it was a girl group\u2019s residence, but I felt like I walked into a whole different world.</p><br/><p>Honestly, I was nervous. It wasn\u2019t just me, Gunyoung, who was behind me, showed clear signs of being nervous.</p><br/><p>As Hyunjo turned on the lights, the hallway instantly brightened.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t very big. It was much better than my one-room, but it seemed like it would be too crowded for four people. A cute, round sofa. The character cushions and dolls spread on top. A cream colored rug. It showed clear traces that only girls lived here.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirls! Wake up and get ready! We have to get to the shop by 5!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang bang!</p><br/><p>Hyunjo knocked on each door twice.</p><br/><p>The first door to open was the one left of the veranda.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa[4], you\u2019re here early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wow.</p><br/><p>Wow\u2026</p><br/><p>It was like when you watch a movie or a drama where the screen brightens up so the female lead looks incredibly beautiful. It was the secret filter used when the producer really wanted to push the lead or if there were some revisions made\u2026</p><br/><p>That was the scene in front of my eyes.</p><hr/><br/><p>[1] JungJumma is taken from Jung Sunwoo and ahjumma (Korean for married woman)[2] Kimbab is Korean sushi rolls.

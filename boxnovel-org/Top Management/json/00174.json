When I looked at the rearview mirror, Son Chaeyoung was staring at the window as though she had said what she wanted. It seemed she didn\u2019t dry her hair all that well as it was still dripping with water.</p><br/><p>I tapped the steering wheel before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you ask to meet to say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Is there a problem? Ah, don\u2019t tell CEO Baek about this conversation too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung looked at the rearview mirror again.</p><br/><p>Reflected on the slightly foggy mirror, her particularly vivid lips parted to say,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Do you want to work with me? Do you want me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied immediately. Son Chaeyoung frowned and turned away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an eyesore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a sleeping mask in the back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung frowned again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo ridiculous. I\u2019ll lose my temper if I keep riding this car.\u201d</p><br/><p>More than now?</p><br/><p>I was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be no reason for you to ride this car anymore so relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied calmly. Son Chaeyoung threw the towel she was wiping her wet clothes with. Then she pressed her back against the seat. I could see the seat getting wet through the rearview mirror. Oh, wow. I bet she\u2019d be rolling in the back seat if I asked her to not get the seat wet one more time.</p><br/><p>A long while after I received her irritated glare through the rearview mirror, Son Chaeyoung snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably understand a lot more about this industry now, yet you still aren\u2019t good at calculating. You need to look at the bigger picture. Do you think you\u2019ll easily come across chances to work with an actress of standing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that told me not to be your manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my words came out wrong because of you! It\u2019s because you asked me for a reason!\u201d</p><br/><p>Should I try to sound her out?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious because you\u2019ve changed suddenly. I was wondering if you\u2019re planning on retiring or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly shrugged and observed her reaction through the rearview mirror.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s mouth was agape as though she heard something absurd.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetire? Why would I retire? Who said I was retiring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking. They say people die if they change suddenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat \u2018suddenly\u2019? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve asked you to be my manager. The train\u2019s already left the station.\u201d</p><br/><p>She snorted again before continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019m never going to retire. What will I do if I give this up?\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know. Although I didn\u2019t know what she did for a living, I did know that she apparently retired.</p><br/><p>It looked like Son Chaeyoung didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of retiring. What caused her to change her mind that she retired at the peak of her career? What sort of rumors were there again?</p><br/><p>Married into a Chinese conglomerate\u2019s family? Undergoing therapy? Pregnancy? Plays overseas?</p><br/><p>The \u2018undergoing therapy\u2019 rumor seemed plausible. She seemed to have two or three mental illnesses.</p><br/><p>But why were they all rumors? Why did no one know the truth?</p><br/><p>If a top actress suddenly declared she was retiring and there were provocative rumors like mental illness or pregnancy, then reporters must have been swarming to find the truth. The paparazzi would have chased her around since she was a top star in China as well.</p><br/><p>But how was the truth buried?</p><br/><p>It would be impossible for Son Chaeyoung to avoid the reporters\u2019 radar by herself.</p><br/><p>Was it really related to a Chinese conglomerate?</p><br/><p>A chief from Team 2 did say something in the past. That the person who owns the hotel we were staying at was such a fan of Son Chaeyoung that he wished to have a meal with her. Seeing Son Chaeyoung\u2019s reaction at that time, it didn\u2019t seem like the first time she was dealing with a situation like that.</p><br/><p>If not, then the company might have actively quelled any information.</p><br/><p>I recalled CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s face as I looked at the rain drip down the windshield.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you again, tell CEO Baek that you won\u2019t be my manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said as she propped her chin on her arm that was on the window. She seemed to have opened the window a little as the wet breeze fluttered her finally dry hair. I saw her half-opened eyes between her fluttering hair. They were restless and excited, like a fighting dog ready to bite and attack its opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you tell him you won\u2019t, the CEO won\u2019t think bad of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard her voice amidst the loud sound of raindrops falling.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause most chief-level managers will say they can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s words were a prophecy.</p><br/><p>After the drive in the rain, Son Chaeyoung showed what a crazy bitch truly was. Thanks to her committing daily acts of violence and wickedness as she ran through a landmine, wails could be heard from the Team 2 office.</p><br/><p>The chief-level managers who the Team 2 Leader set up with Son Chaeyoung quit one after the other like dragonflies swept up in a storm. I heard this from Chief Lee Bongjoon, but a chief who said he would control Son Chaeyoung later clung to the Team 2 Leader\u2019s calves, saying he couldn\u2019t do it any longer.</p><br/><p>That was why Chief Jo, who was familiar with Son Chaeyoung, was temporarily assigned to Son Chaeyoung once again. I saw Chief Jo a few times at work, his initial impression of a neighborhood hyung became a ruined man.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Chief Jo and the Team 2 Leader was doing whatever they could to soothe Son Chaeyoung, but it was already the fifth day of the week CEO Baek Hansung gave them. Incidents were constantly bursting at Team 2.</p><br/><p>And one was about to burst in our team as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa! Oppa, oppa, take the picture when it bursts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it and pull.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuaah! How can I not worry when you\u2019re the one taking the picture?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Party poppers that is.</p><br/><p>The fan club sent us a table-sized cake to commemorate Making Film hitting 15% in ratings. We were holding a party in the fourth-floor lounge to express our thanks and take photos showing us eating the cake.</p><br/><p>A photo of everyone wearing party hats and cream on their lips.</p><br/><p>I took a step back from the noisy center. Then I captured a bunch of photos clearly illustrating the event with a digital camera. One where Neptune launched the party poppers above their heads, and people eating cake like they were starved.</p><br/><p>The three goldfish were laughing like they were drunk.</p><br/><p>Jung Jae was busy serving pieces of cake and drinks.</p><br/><p>I was taking pictures for a while when Chief Lee Taeshin swaggered over and sat down. With a face that seemed to almost suffocate with emotions, he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day, after their performance, it looks like they gained a lot of confidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they had never performed where the audience cheered so loudly.\u201d</p><br/><p>As though he recalled that moment, Chief Lee Taeshin let out an excited breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey had gone up thinking that people might boo or throw garbage at them, but a cheer erupted out from somewhere and spread instantly. That moment replays in mind a few times every day that I can\u2019t go about my daily activities properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>He added while looking at Pretty Girls,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m like this, then it must have been much more meaningful to them. They\u2019ll probably never forget it in their lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that it\u2019ll remain as a good memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied as I turned the camera.</p><br/><p>Through the viewfinder, the goldfish looked happy like they were having a wonderful dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>I heard someone say beside me. I turned around while holding the camera. I saw Lee Songha through the viewfinder. Lee Songha was sitting next to me instead of Chief Lee Taeshin at some point. She was holding two pieces of cake. Her eyes, which were fluffier than the cream, looked at me.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t even surprised anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you always know what the left hand doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha turned her head away. Only her head.</p><br/><p>Still sitting, she silently shuffled her chair until she was right next to me.</p><br/><p>Finding her actions funny, I pressed the shutter again.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a haunted house while they on a carousel? What the heck is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee of the Management Team 2 grumbled. He groaned intermittently. His mental state was exhausted in two days. Of course, it was because of Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one floor between us in the same building, yet isn\u2019t the atmosphere too different?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the person beside him. Chief Jo nodded with the exhausted eyes of a dried fish. They were standing in the corner of the stairwell on their way up. The fourth-floor lounge was in the middle of its loud party.</p><br/><p>The two stared at the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo, that guy has incredible luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee\u2019s gaze lingered on Jung Sunwoobefore looking at Pretty Girls and Neptune. The loud and warm scene in front of them could only be titled as \u2018Happy\u2019.</p><br/><p>He licked his lips and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can he be with such good girls? While we\u2019ll have to wait and see about Pretty Girls, Neptune should have had some sort of problem by now. It\u2019s so odd that none of them have taken up a bad behavior or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey need to be awarded an upright celebrity certificate or something. And on top of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned his gaze to Lee Songha, who was quietly sitting next to Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer. Lee Songha\u2019s the real deal, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo replied bitterly.</p><br/><p>Unsatisfied with Chief Jo\u2019s response, Chief Lee urged on,</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean I thought she was quiet after Cat Guardian Ghost became a hit because she was still in the start of her career, but she hasn\u2019t changed a bit even after two more successful projects and as her popularity grows by the day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet there\u2019s no one as easy to work with than her amongst those at her level. She\u2019s not stubborn, fickle, and doesn\u2019t cause any incidents. She also doesn\u2019t have interests outside of work, so you don\u2019t have to worry about a scandal either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee counted with his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like her work is just okay. Have you ever seen her get irritated or say she doesn\u2019t like something to Jung Sunwoo? She hasn\u2019t complained once even though her schedule was packed for half a year with her drama and movie overlapping and Neptune\u2019s schedule as well. She\u2019s completely different from Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Chief Lee talked, the more bitter Chief Jo\u2019s expression became.</p><br/><p>Like there was something that bothered him.</p><br/><p>Chief Jo opened his cracked lips and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Songha\u2019s reputation is quite good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot just good. Almost historically great. Dramas, movie, commercials, photoshoots, no bad rumors came out of anything she does. Everyone just wants to work with her again. I\u2019ve seen tons of celebrities while working, but it\u2019s my first time seeing someone like her. She\u2019s just perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee\u2019s voice dripped with desire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll probably be tons of people getting in line if she looks for a new manager. I\u2019ve been interested every time I\u2019ve seen her. I feel like it\u2019ll be like winning the lottery every day if I manage her. Aren\u2019t you interested, Chief Jo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s say her manager changes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Her manager is going to change?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee immediately asked. He seemed like he would immediately go and introduce himself if that was the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cHypothetically.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo shook his head. Then he swallowed his saliva and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s because our higher-ups said so or whatever, let\u2019s just say that her manager changes. But she suddenly starts causing all sorts of problems. She can\u2019t act, doesn\u2019t listen, and causes issues.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you say such terrifying things? That\u2019s Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo if she suddenly acts like Son Chaeyoung, then what will the higher-ups do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee rolled his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey try to soothe her as much as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know from dealing with Son Chaeyoung? Do you think that\u2019ll work? Also, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s already a well-known hellion, so at least you\u2019ll get people\u2019s sympathy. What do you think will happen if Lee Songha acts like that under your care?\u201d</p><br/><p>As though he had imagined this, Chief Lee frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess they\u2019ll scold me, asking what I was doing for her to act like that when she was so calm with Jung Sunwoo. Damn it, just thinking about it is suffocating.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his shoulders and changed his thoughts,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll probably have Jung Sunwoo manage her again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation with Son Chaeyoung is this bad because there\u2019s no one to rein her in. But you\u2019re saying Lee Songha won\u2019t cause problems so long as she\u2019s with Jung Sunwoo. That\u2019s what I would do if I was an executive.\u201d</p><br/><p>While listening to this, Chief Jo\u2019s expression became odd.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee tapped his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you thinking about this? It\u2019s just so drastic. Although Lee Songha does follow Jung Sunwoo particularly well, do you really think she\u2019ll act like Son Chaeyoung because her manager changed? When they are polar opposites?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe conversation we had just now, I said the same thing in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? With who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo stared at Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Although she was simply sitting there with no makeup or lights, she gave off an uncommon feeling. There was a sense of distance like she was in a far-off world by herself. However, her expression lit up whenever she talked with Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>Like a wax figure coming to life.</p><br/><p>Chief Jo mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a bit crazy, that\u2019s what she said. She might be fooling us all.\u201d</p><br/><p>He cautiously said.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee, who looked at him with bulging eyes, laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be really feeling the aftereffects of Son Chaeyoung. Isn\u2019t this considered trauma?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee clicked his tongue and massaged Chief Jo\u2019s lean shoulders.</p><br/><p>Chief Jo opened and closed his mouth a few times at his reaction but sighed in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s just what I think. She\u2019s safe because the safety pin\u2019s still on.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at Lee Songha and Jung Sunwoo again and added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we pull the safety pin, I think she\u2019ll be worse than Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> A verse from Matthew 6:3</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-173\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 173\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-175\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 175\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201461\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Our eyes met. I unconsciously put more strength into my toes. I felt like I was walking down a long, dark tunnel alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly went down the stairs when Lee Songha raised her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI broke a glass. Stay there because there are glass shards.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said in her normal voice before scrubbing the marble step with her left high hell. The sound of shattering glass was unpleasant. Lee Songha brushed her hair to the side. Her nicely arranged hair became untidy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean it up before someone gets hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Jae, go tell Kwanwoo about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Jung Jae, who was on her way down, quickly ran up to the fifth floor.</p><br/><p>I looked back at Lee Songha and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you hurt anywhere? If it broke, you should have avoided it. Why did you step on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was lost in my thoughts for a second. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha bent her knees a few times as if to prove it. I examined her leg that extended out from her skirt. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t see any blood\u2026 Or so I thought. Her stocking ripped and a strand sprung off. Lee Songha stealthily moved her leg back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot hurt? First\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I trailed off. I heard someone make a fuss downstairs and people began to gather. They were busy trying to get in an extra word to Lee Songha, asking her if she was fine or if she was hurt. Lee Songha pressed her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I had too much champagne. I slipped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my! It\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t fall!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if I did, I would have rolled and gracefully gotten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Roll?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI learned gymnastics while filming Alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no need for me to intervene. She skillfully settled the crowd by explaining the situation and playing it off with a laugh. As expected, she felt unfamiliar. Even though CEO Baek Hansung wasn\u2019t here, she seemed so unfamiliar to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>I acted before more people gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlass pieces might have gotten into your stockings. Go downstairs and have a closer look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving her in Neptune\u2019s care, I cleaned up the broken glass and calmed down the worrying people. I then went down to the second-floor basement. I heard voices in the practice room in the basement, which was dark because people had left early for the party.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was sitting on the floor, and Im Seoyoung was touching her leg.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t hurt! How can you throw a glass just because you had nothing else to throw?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. I didn\u2019t throw it, it dropped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee held Lee Songha\u2019s face, who was in denial.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. Are you drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha pressed her cheek against Lee Taehee\u2019s hand. Im Seoyoung snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if! You, the same girl who drank wild ginseng wine with unni, drunk after a couple glasses of champagne?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe alcohol today is different. You get drunk more easily on days like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you try to sell snake oil! Did your trauma reappear after seeing Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrauma?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha slowly rolled the word in her mouth. Then she mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel anything when I see Son Chaeyoung anymore. Rather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha shook her head and changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m drunk. I want to see oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while entering the room. At least shoulders flinched.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me talk with Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, then should we stand on guard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I need you to stand guard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-because something might occur that shouldn\u2019t be discovered by others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing like that\u2019ll happen. We\u2019re just going to talk. Just close the door. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a drink from the vending machine.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said instead. Her smiling eyes had an impertinent air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere could be people whose imaginations will run wild if we appear by ourselves. Like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung and LJ left first, and Lee Taehee closed the door behind her. The practice room became quiet. I examined her leg, devoid of any scratches, and opened my mouth to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m a bit confused.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha spoke first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI might have thrown it. Since I wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I asked Jae if she wanted acting lessons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>She frankly replied as her gaze fell to the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt made me think of the past. When you asked me if I had any thoughts on acting. Right here, in this practice room. That memory was always vivid like it only happened yesterday, but it suddenly felt like it was such a long time ago. And I thought about Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung?</p><br/><p>After taking a breath, Lee Songha continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of that\u2026 I can understand why Son Chaeyoung hated me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll be better than me at acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>She asked in a crumbling voice. Like someone enduring a chill, Lee Songha wrapped her arms around herself. Her fingers holding onto her forearms were white. Tears hung on the corners of her lowered eyelashes.</p><br/><p>My mouth tasted bitter. So much that it was difficult to swallow.</p><br/><p>It was simply a casual suggestion. Just because I happened to remember that people called Jung Jae \u2018the Second Lee Songha\u2019 in the future vision I saw in the past. Reporters might have exaggerated because she was the center of a rising girl group, but I was curious if she really had talent in acting.</p><br/><p>If she showed talent after a few lessons, I would foster it, but if not, I would have made her focus on her singing career. I only brought it up to figure that out. Did that sound like a death sentence to Lee Songha?</p><br/><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha whispered like she was making a confession.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to become normal. Because I can\u2019t become like Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another voice overlapped with hers in my mind.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s voice, which was embedded deep in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 That\u2019s why most of them depend on something. That could be drugs, alcohol, or the like\u2026 Or someone. Make her depend on you. So that she doesn\u2019t turn her gaze to something else.\u2019</p><br/><p>I knew how Lee Songha felt about me. I also knew that it was so complicated and tangled that it would be difficult to explore every aspect of that emotion. Because I played a part in it. Even though I knew she was excessively unconditional and had an obsessive side to her.</p><br/><p>To make her depend and lean on me above all else.</p><br/><p>I licked my dry lips and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are different from Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I wish that was true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha raised her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, I\u2019ll handle my schedule with another chief from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words I was about to say to her were all pushed aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you are barely managing my schedule. I know, but I keep thinking, \u2018only a bit more,\u2019 and it has come this far. You\u2019ll be much busier from now, so you don\u2019t need to take care of my schedule. I\u2019ll stand on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stand on your own?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, if, from another team\u2026 If there\u2019s a chief from Team 2 who wants to work with me, that\u2019s fine too. That\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to experience anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s fine with me handing her over to another team\u2019s chief?</p><br/><p>Anger suddenly surged. It was so severe that the unpleasantness I had felt until was almost cute. My emotions were so turbulent that I felt sick. I swallowed dryly and rubbed the corner of my lips.</p><br/><p>I was in no position to think Lee Songha\u2019s situation was unique. If I had a champagne flute in my hand right now, it might have shattered into more pieces that Lee Songha\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The suspicions and caution that had accumulated over the past few days finally burst.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the CEO tell you to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung\u2019s matter. And now you. Did the CEO order you?\u201d</p><br/><p>My mind was a mess, but the words coming out of my mouth flowed so smoothly that it was surprising.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha blinked her eyes, taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr threatened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Threatened.</p><br/><p>Finally spitting out that word, which was dwelling in my mind all this time, my suspicions seemed to grow even larger.</p><br/><p>What kind of person was CEO Baek Hansung? Was he a good person or a bad one?</p><br/><p>My future self said that he became disenchanted with CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s methods and left W&amp;U. He then corrected himself, saying that it would have been better to stay under CEO Baek Hansung. That, in a world full of black-hearted people, a man like him was still grey.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung, who I had observed until now, was talented and even reliable at times. Also, Son Chaeyoung described him to be someone who tied celebrities under his company by finding their weakness.</p><br/><p>If I became disenchanted with CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s methods, then I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha asked with a strange expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you hear? What I told you last time was really all. What I said to you were purely my own thoughts. There weren\u2019t any threats or anything. Why would the CEO do something so extreme?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Because Lee Songha grew big enough that people referred to a walking one-person company. Because she grew big enough that CEO Baek Hansung called her W&amp;U\u2019s poster star. There were only three years left on her seven-year exclusive contract, and the CEO and his executives were probably thinking and preparing for the future.</p><br/><p>Also, because CEO Baek Hansung might be someone who was more comfortable with threatening someone than persuading them.</p><br/><p>Like me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, that photo. The one that was taken with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 photo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha abruptly looked shocked like someone who had just been hit. Her torso staggered backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that photo is something that\u2019s holding you down, I can-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! That photo is ju-just an embarrassing past. It\u2019s not something that can hold me down. It\u2019s something I can simply close my eyes and handle if it ever got released.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, why are you suddenly worried about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>I repeatedly confirmed it while nodding my head. She didn\u2019t look like she was acting. Was Lee Songha someone who could fool someone, me, like it was nothing? Was I suffering from obsession? Were there really no secret threats I didn\u2019t know?</p><br/><p>Even if that was true, would it continue to be the case?</p><br/><p>My head ached. I was a walking mental ward.</p><br/><p>I sighed and told her,</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, if something like that ever happens, you need to tell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha came closer. In a worried voice, she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as good of a person as you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than being threatened, I think about threatening others, no, I\u2019m worried that I will. Also, you don\u2019t need to worry about the CEO anymore. I\u2019m not really scared of him anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only one I\u2019m scared of is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I heard that, the thread that had been pulled tight for a long while finally snapped.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>It really did seem like we entered summer. It was early in the morning, yet the sun was already out. Lying down and staring at the curtain\u2019s fluttering shadow, I grabbed my phone.</p><br/><p>Reporters, producers, and writers, who didn\u2019t distinguish between night and day, had filled my call history with missed called. I would have checked each one normally, but I pushed them all aside today and called someone. Immediately, I heard a noisy background and a voice.</p><br/><p>-What with the busiest person in the world calling me this early in the morning? Are you getting off work now?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my day off.\u201d</p><br/><p>-You get days off? (Dad, what is it? Is it his day off? Hasn\u2019t it been a million years since his last one? Let\u2019s tell him to come over if it\u2019s his day off!) You hear them, right? Even the kids are surprised.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t surprising to hear since I had worked hard without taking a breath for a while. I didn\u2019t even know when the last time I rested an entire day without thinking about work was. My friends were talking about how I\u2019ve completely disappeared after telling them to think I went back to mandatory military service.</p><br/><p>-I heard it\u2019ll get easier if you went from a road manager to a chief, but why is it that you get busier by the day? It\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve gone home too. Do you even have a life? Thirty is just around the corner, yet I haven\u2019t heard that you\u2019re seeing someone. (Dad! I-I also want to say something!)</p><br/><p>Soon, I heard a serious voice from the other side.</p><br/><p>-Uncle! On TV, it said that youth is from your teens to your twenties! You won\u2019t be young next year!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re all past your \u2018cute\u2019 age, you\u2019re gross. Be respectful when talking to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Uncle called us gross!</p><br/><p>I heard my brother laugh amidst the quadruplets\u2019 shouts.</p><br/><p>-They are acting like that because they miss you.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while grabbing onto my bed and pulling myself up.</p><br/><p>-You\u2019re coming? You can?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the project is over, I can take a breather. I need to organize a few things too. About that.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something I want your advice on.\u201d</p><br/><p>-With me? What kind of advice? About life?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, about dating.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-181\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 181\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-183\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 183\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201477\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

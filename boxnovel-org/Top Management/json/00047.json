Is it really fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung was more worried than Lee Songha, who was directly involved. No, Lee Taehee and LJ were sending me worried looks as if they hadn\u2019t been in a festive mood just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, aren\u2019t you saying this so that we won\u2019t worry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m really not worried about it. Controversies like this will all disappear once Lee Songha proves her acting skills. Just think of it as noise marketing. There will be more people interested in Cat Guardian Ghost, and the viewership ratings for the first broadcast will be higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I shrugged my shoulders, Im Seoyoung opened and closed her mouth a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s true\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you too optimistic? If\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ glanced at Lee Songha before dragging off.</p><br/><p>They were probably worried in case Lee Songha\u2019s acting skills weren\u2019t enough to put this controversy to rest. Not just them, anyone would be worried.</p><br/><p>As there were countless idols who took a step into the drama industry with strong ambitions before failing once they showed their terrible acting skills.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>When I turned around, my eyes met with Lee Songha, who was still looking at me. When I looked at her eyes, which seemed to convey, \u2018Is there a big problem?\u2019 I unknowingly smiled.</p><br/><p>We had practiced the script for the past few weeks. We had met with Writer Hong Jumi and Director Shin Taekyun multiple times and shared our thoughts on the character, and the new acting teacher marveled at Lee Songha\u2019s acting skills every time.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t see the exact future of this incident.</p><br/><p>So, it was impossible for me to be 100% certain about the way things would unfold.</p><br/><p>However, I couldn\u2019t imagine the viewers getting up in arms because Lee Songha wasn\u2019t good at acting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to take words from people who don\u2019t know anything to heart. Don\u2019t worry, Songha. You just need to do as you\u2019ve always been doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Kim Hyunjo came out of the kitchen and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cPack your things. Team Leader Park is still at the company so let\u2019s go and check how things progress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed my outerwear, laptop and bag and got up. Kim Hyunjo told the girls, who were following us with complicated expressions,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this is something we\u2019ve expected since Seo Jijoon was confirmed in the drama Lee Songha was cast in. It will die down soon, so you just think about the good things. We spread Neptune\u2019s name in today\u2019s broadcast. If we continue like this, things are going to get better every day from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about oppas? Oppas won\u2019t be able to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are going to talk for a bit at the company before leaving. Taehee, you take care of the girls. Don\u2019t let Seoyoung use the internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied, scratching her neck. Then, in a small voice, she added,</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me if things blow up. I won\u2019t be sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><br/><p>We left the residence, feeling the girls\u2019 gazes on our backs.</p><br/><p>Unlike Kim Hyunjo\u2019s prediction that we would leave right away, we met the morning sun inside the meeting room.</p><br/><p>This was the longest, most nauseating night since I joined.</p><br/><p>It took a little longer for the full drunken effect of the wild ginseng wine to set in, the vibrating noises from cell phones scattered around me gave me a headache and attempting to look at my laptop screen with letters the size of sesame seeds for hours made nausea reach my throat.</p><br/><p>Then, I was too uneasy about the public\u2019s opinion of Lee Songha to go home and rest.</p><br/><p>In the end, the three of us left the rest to Team Leader Park and the PR team and went to sleep for a bit. It was 3 a.m. when I said goodnight to Kim Hyunjo and the traitor before coming to the sleeping area on the first floor and closing my eyes. That was the last memory I had.</p><br/><p>When I opened my eyes again, Kim Hyunjo was looking down at me like a grim reaper.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was about to die of heart failure just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked around with my half-opened eyes, my heart thumped once more. The traitor\u2019s face was floating on the other side of the sleeping area. What a scare. When I calmed my heart and looked again, he was staring at his phone.</p><br/><p>With an enthralled face.</p><br/><p>Why was he like that?</p><br/><p>I stretched my body while tilting my head. I heard cracking sounds from my shoulders and back. Euah, I feel like I\u2019m dying. Today was the day we were going to release the exhaustion that had been piling up by coming to work late.</p><br/><p>Damn. I came to my senses while inwardly cursing Producer Go Joontae.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, what about the public opinion? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. On one hand, it ended well, on the other, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo picked up my phone that was rolling around my pillow and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the real-time searches. It\u2019s a historic event so prepare yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>A historic event?</p><br/><p>I tilted my head as I turned my phone on and freaked out.</p><br/><p>I had 48 missed calls.</p><br/><p>When I looked through it, the majority were unknown numbers, and the occasional numbers that were saved on my phone were from reporters I had met at drinking parties. There were some who called multiple times, and there were tons of messages asking me to call them back when I saw their message.</p><br/><p>I thought I had slept for half a day, but that wasn\u2019t it either. When I looked at the time, I only slept for 3 hours. It was 6 a.m. right now, not even the sun was up yet.</p><br/><p>Do these people think managers don\u2019t need sleep? What\u2019s with their rude behavior?</p><br/><p>Wait, don\u2019t tell me the public opinion became worse?</p><br/><p>I quickly checked the ranking of real-time search terms.</p><br/><p>Then, as soon I saw it, I realized what Kim Hyunjo meant. And the reason why the traitor was so captivated as he looked at his phone.</p><br/><p>8<sup>th</sup>, Neptune.</p><br/><p>6<sup>th</sup>, Next K-Star.</p><br/><p>5<sup>th</sup>, Cat Guardian Ghost.</p><br/><p>And\u2026 Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Her name was first on the real-time search rankings.</p><br/><p>I waited for a day like this.</p><br/><p>A day when the names of Neptune\u2019s members would appear on real-time search rankings. A day where articles about them would be on the main page of entertainment news sites, where countless reporters wrote and published articles about them.</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t wish for things to progress like this\u2026</p><br/><p>The headline on the main page and the headlines from articles beneath all had Neptune and Lee Songha\u2019s name in them.</p><br/><p>First, I checked all the articles that were published after I went to sleep.</p><br/><p>[Neptune member Lee Songha, Chemistry with Seo Jijoon from the same company in their new drama] [Lee Songha joins \u2018Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019, is it another package casting?] [\u201cHer singing was criticized, so she\u2019s acting?\u201d Girl group Neptune\u2019s member Lee Songha\u2019s actions are being hated by netizens]\u00a0</p><br/><p>[As the girl group Neptune, who appeared on Next K-Star and received praise for their skills which were unlike a rookie group, is trending, their member Lee Songha is swept with controversy.When the fact that TVL\u2019s new drama starting in January cast Seo Jijoon together with Lee Songha was revealed, there are suspicions that this may be an \u2018Add-on\u2019.</p><br/><p>The fact that she was cast with one audition and that she has no history in acting, and the fact that she is a rookie with no popularity in the country and overseas are only increasing people\u2019s suspicions.</p><br/><p>On top of that, it has been revealed that Lee Songha auditioned two days after being told that her skills were lacking compared to her other members after their Next K-Star mission performance. Netizens ask, \u201cDidn\u2019t she jump to acting without any preparations because her singing was criticized?\u201d as they look unfavorably upon this incident\u2026]</p><br/><p>I was about to go crazy.</p><br/><p>I closed the browser within 3 seconds of turning it on. Swears and sarcastic remarks I had never heard before were taking the top spots. I calmed my shocked heart and looked through the articles again.</p><br/><p>I saw some changes in the headlines after the company\u2019s first public explanation.</p><br/><p>[From Lee Songha\u2019s side, \u201cCat Guardian Ghost was a project we were discussing before this.\u201d] [\u2018Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019 producer, \u201cNot an \u2018Add-on\u2019, a unanimous decision to cast her after her audition\u201d]\u00a0</p><br/><p>In articles referring to the press release, they wrote that Lee Songha was a member who was already receiving acting lessons and that Cat Guardian Ghost was a project they had been discussing internally before the filming of Next K-Star\u2019s first broadcast.</p><br/><p>They also included that Lee Songha herself asked for an audition after reading the synopsis and that Seo Jijoon joined after Lee Songha auditioned and was already cast.</p><br/><p>They mentioned CEO Kim Pansuk from Pan Production as well.</p><br/><p>Because of this, the situation, where there was overwhelming criticism towards Lee Songha, roughly reached an equilibrium. However, the controversy didn\u2019t seem to want to die down and continued to heat up.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only on articles, social media and other community sites had pages and pages of comments regarding this incident.</p><ul><li>Their media brainwashing is op. They should just acknowledge she was added in after Seo Jijoon and accept criticism. No matter who looks at it, it\u2019s obvious they added her in, but since they aren\u2019t acknowledging it, they are getting bashed even more. How detestable.</li><li>They say it\u2019s not true so what is there to acknowledge? They said that there was a unanimous agreement after her audition.</li><li>They probably won\u2019t be able to handle the backlash if they say she was cast through her acting skills lol. It seems they are looking down on acting. What are they going to say if she terrible after this? haha</li><li>Those who are saying she will obviously suck at acting without seeing it, you guys are amazing.</li></ul><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and minimized the browser.</p><br/><p>Some comments felt as though each character was filled with ill intent. To the point where I wanted to ask if they had a grudge against Lee Songha. If this was enough to make me, a third-party, frowned at this, what would Lee Songha think if she saw these comments\u2026</p><br/><p>Although Kim Hyunjo called the girls and told them not to let Lee Songha use the internet, it still concerned me.</p><br/><p>What do we have to do to calm this controversy?</p><br/><p>Although we could only solve a controversy about acting with acting, there was still a month until the drama\u2019s first broadcast.</p><br/><p>Did we have to upload a video of her practicing her lines? Would people believe that she was cast after an audition and not as an add-on then?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this fuss all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader entered the meeting room. It looked as though he came straight here as he held his bag in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018all of a sudden\u2019? It was a mess since early morning,\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Kim Hyunjo with a sunken face. The team 3 leader clicked his tongue when he saw his face,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are constantly in the top rankings? Songha\u2019s first, and Cat Guardian Ghost is fifth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Cat Guardian Ghost just went up to fourth,\u201d</p><br/><p>Corrected the traitor who was tapping away on his laptop as if there was a war.</p><br/><p>When I refreshed the browser, I saw that Cat Guardian Ghost was fourth. Lee Songha was still first, and below her was Next K-Star, Neptune, and even Seo Jijoon. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that the aftermath of yesterday\u2019s broadcast was dominating the real-time search rankings.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader went behind the traitor and looked at his screen before mumbling,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, really. I thought things would pass after we took some criticism, but it looks like things will spread if we make a mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already spread everywhere,\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Team Leader Park, who was unable to take her eyes of her monitor.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Park, why is your voice so hoarse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I had a fight with Next K-Star\u2019s side on the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>At those words, the team 3 leader\u2019s eyes became even angrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose damn bastards, what are they saying on their end?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are saying that they are sorry, saying that they only wanted to promote Cat Guardian Ghost since it\u2019s a drama from an affiliate and that they never knew it would become this heated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if that makes sense. You should have sworn at them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did. But their program became a hit so they aren\u2019t going to fuss about being sworn at by us. They say that their viewership ratings hit around 2% in the middle of the broadcast and stayed there. Since it has become such a hot topic, there will be tons of people who will download it or watch the rerun, and the viewership ratings for the second episode will be higher. They are probably splitting their profits right about now.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-46\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 46\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-48\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 48\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201206\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

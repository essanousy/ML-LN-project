Zombies poured out from the building entrance.</p><br/><p>Zombies even jumped off the roof and through the shattered windows.</p><br/><p>The party of survivors narrowly got in a delivery truck. The tires spun in place against the shattered concrete. Dust filled the air. The tsunami of zombies charged at the survivors.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?! Drive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, quickly! At this rate, we\u2019re all going to fucking die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouts, screams, and the roars of zombies jumbled together.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The production producer said with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see something like this in a film from our country.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of people in suits stretched their necks out to watch the monitor. They were from corporations that had or were planning to invest in Alive as well as sales reps that exported Korean content overseas.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really thrilling. It\u2019ll be amazing to see this on the big screen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? It\u2019ll be quite a sight seeing this after they\u2019ve added music and retouched the scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe zombies look realistic. It really shows a lot of money went into this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was worried because it would release at the same time as Hollywood blockbusters, but this might be worth competing against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Positive comments continued. The production producer was all smiled as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cast is top-notch and so is their chemistry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monitor displayed the party of survivors fighting desperately against the zombies.</p><br/><p>The marketing employee from SBE Film, Kang Minjeong, added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only possible to cast such actors because it\u2019s Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s scenario. You can\u2019t cast a lineup like this just by waving money at them. You know that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say about the actors. They are all top stars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey also sell a ton of tickets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope the movie poster is a full shot of the cast. Making sure their faces are visible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production producer and marketing team employee smiled at the scent of money.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After the long escape scene was over and while the investment team was meeting the party of suits, the production producer stepped back and wiped off his smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 They\u2019ve opened their pockets, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong chewed on her red lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, their reaction isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s not as much as we expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer pulled his curly hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe CEO told us to knock their socks off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems they expected this much. I thought that seeing the shoot would push us beyond expectations, but I didn\u2019t expect their reactions to be lukewarm from seeing around 100 people dressed up as zombies. With this sort of reaction, it\u2019ll be difficult to squeeze more investments from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there some other way? We pretty much have no other way to get money than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat we can show them\u2026 What did you say the next scene was?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScenes 24 and 25. It has Lee Kihwan and Lee Songha as well as the appearance of an unknown actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production producer replied. A complicated sigh followed after.</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong quickly flipped through the scenario she had held under her arm.</p><br/><p>Soon, she too sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe unknown actor appearing in this scene, it\u2019s him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The rookie Chief Jung Sunwoo brought on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong closed the scenario and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat actor, what is he doing right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The minivan\u2019s doors were wide open.</p><br/><p>A strange mood hung in the air.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was staring at the passenger seat with eyes dripping with longing. To be precise, she was looking at Nam Joyoon, who was sitting in the passenger seat. To be even more precise, she was looking at the lunch box in his hands.</p><br/><p>Under her uncomfortable gaze, Nam Joyoon had a difficult expression.</p><br/><p>He handed her his lunch box.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you like some?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t steal other people\u2019s food.\u201d</p><br/><p>She refused with a sorrowful face.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon\u2019s lunch box was filled with thick grilled short rib patties and side dishes. There was even a fried egg on top of the perfectly-cooked multi-grain rice.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked down at her unique lunch box.</p><br/><p>It had pieces of chicken breast and greens around it with no dressing. She had been eating this for the past two months. Tormented by it, Lee Songha secretly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we trade a single bite? Two of my chicken breasts for a quarter of the short rib patty\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can just eat it. I can\u2019t eat all of it anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha held her breath back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t eat all of this? How can you not eat all of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot eating much has become a habit of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon said while scratching his neck.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked at him. Her wary gaze had completely disappeared, instead, she looked like she was looking at a comrade whom she would even share half a bean with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her stylist quickly intercepted just before her chopsticks touched a patty.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, I\u2019m going to tattle on Chief Jung. Hurry up and eat your food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha grumbled in a gloomy voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is feed. Dogs eat better than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Chief Jung got up early in the morning to personally make it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to eat it, pass it here. Let\u2019s have a taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha hastily took possession of her lunch box.</p><br/><p>Her stylist giggled. Then she whispered to Nam Joyoon,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m letting you know now because the two of them had a scandal, but you can consider Lee Songha as more of a fanatic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA fanatic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has this pseudo-religion she believes in. Call the Church of Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon cracked a smile.</p><br/><p>Just then, Lee Songha, who had been gazing at her lunchbox like it was a treasure box, blinked. She had been staring down at her lunchbox like she was going to wolf it down, yet she suddenly put her chopsticks down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why? Are you not going to eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha smiled happily as she replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I touch it, the heart will be destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeart? Where\u2019s the heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook closely. From here to here. A heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her fingers outlined a crooked circle. It was the shape of the veggies surrounding the pieces of chicken breasts. The stylist examined her lunch box with a strange expression before looking at Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does that look like a heart to you?\u2019 She asked with her gaze.</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? Does it taste okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo asked as he suddenly got in the minivan.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was surprised, and because of it, the lunch box in her hands lurched. Lee Songha quickly looked back down at her lunch box before she despaired like a person who had lost her country.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, she kills me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The stylist rolled over laughing.</p><br/><p>A faint smile hung on Nam Joyoon\u2019s lips as well.</p><br/><p>Only Jung Sunwoo looked at them with lost eyes.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s actors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Minjeong said as she looked at the white minivan in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even have a sliver of tension.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? They are the only ones that seem like they\u2019re on a picnic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production producer agreed with a dispirited laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering they are about to do an emotional scene, they are excessively easygoing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we give Lee Songha a pass since she\u2019s the type to get in character quickly, that rookie, Nam Joyoon\u2026 What gall\u2026 On his first day to boot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Minjeong clicked her tongue as she came to a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the investors somewhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? Still, it\u2019ll be difficult to convince the investors with-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next scene is one that could be almost completely edited out depending on the shoot. If we disappoint them by showing a rookie we\u2019re not confident in, it\u2019s worse than not showing them the shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Minjeong resolutely said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better not to show the investors the next scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we watch the next scene before we leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Minjeong\u2019s smile crumbled at one of the people from an investment company\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, there isn\u2019t much to see in the next scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that, but I\u2019m still curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just one person. Other people were curious as well.</p><br/><p>Kim Minjeong barely managed to smooth out her frown as she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 are you curious about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe actors aren\u2019t leaving after finishing their shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are apparently going to leave after seeing this scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Minjeong and the production producer hastily turned around.</p><br/><p>\u2018Starcraft\u2019 vans<sup>{1}</sup>, as well as other vans, were still parked despite their actors having finished filming for the day. The two also saw actors gathered behind the director\u2019s chair, talking with Director Choi Sungwon.</p><br/><p>Their expression crumbled.</p><br/><p>Scene 24 was an inside shoot.</p><br/><p>A monitor reflected Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon, who were checking positions. The actors who were done filming for the day were sitting in the chairs with their names on the back as they looked at the monitor. Each of them had a bag of chips in their hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks different from what I expected reading the script.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Lee Songha leaves a strong impression from head to toe, I thought he\u2019d be similar. But he looks normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, people like Lee Songha aren\u2019t common.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon chuckled when he heard them discussing like middle-aged women at a laundromat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all like this? Putting pressure on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave after checking the beginning. We just want to see how he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us see. Little old me wants to feel some thrills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The actors said as they planted their butts in their seats.</p><br/><p>A few steps away, the investors whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cNam Joyoon? I thought I\u2019d know his face even if his name was unfamiliar, but it\u2019s my first time seeing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis role also has quite a few lines. Isn\u2019t his popularity too low?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? There are much better actors I know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk to SBE Film after the shoot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Their voices were tinged with dissatisfaction. The production producer and Kang Minjeong, who overheard their conversation, let out frustrated sighs. Looking around, Kang Minjeong went to a man standing with his arms crossed.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, there are a lot of people watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat seems true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jung Sunwoo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about Ms. Lee Songha. We already know she\u2019s great at acting and have seen how hard she worked preparing for her role. However, we are a bit worried about Mr. Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Minjeong\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we believe in him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey both worked hard for their roles.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said with a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo please believe in them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gazes with various thoughts focused on the monitor.</p><br/><p>Just then, the slate smacked together.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The living room was a mess.</p><br/><p>A child flopped on the floor sniffled. The female high schooler Lee Yeonwoo checked up on the child with quick glances. She did this while her hands moved all the objects blocking the way to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>A man\u2019s faint voice seeped out from behind the slightly opened door.</p><br/><p>{\u2026 This was the only place to hide because the front door was broken.}</p><br/><p>{At first, I thought people trapped a monster in here from the sounds. How could people leave someone here alone\u2026}</p><br/><p>{I couldn\u2019t ask them to bring me along when even the lives of perfectly healthy people were at risk.}</p><br/><p>The weak voice gradually gained strength.</p><br/><p>{It was bearable. It\u2019s a bathroom so there\u2019s a toilet, water from the sink, and they left some food for me.}</p><br/><p>Soon, the objects in front of the bathroom door were completely cleared. Just as Lee Yeonwoo stretched her hand out to grab the doorknob, the door flung open. Lee Yeonwoo retreated in surprise. The man, who she had been talking to just now, was standing at the entrance.</p><br/><p>{I thought I\u2019d die like this.}</p><br/><p>The man smiled brightly like someone who had been rescued from hell.</p><br/><p>The hallway was quiet thanks to all the zombies having gone outside.</p><br/><p>Lee Yeonwoo took the lead. She held the child with one arm and hung a bag with foods like instant noodles and canned hams and other necessities.</p><br/><p>A man limped behind her. He too was carrying a heavy bag.</p><br/><p>What broke the silence was when they discovered someone approaching them from across the hall.</p><br/><p>{Mister!}</p><br/><p>{Oh, Yeonwoo! Why are you- Did you remain as well?}</p><br/><p>Jang Taeyoung, a well-built man in his thirties, came over with a surprised look.</p><br/><p>A young woman stuck behind him with slumped shoulders.</p><br/><p>{I escaped with Jinjoo, but we ended up having to hide. How about you?}</p><br/><p>{I found a few other survivors on the higher levels so I came to save them.}</p><br/><p>{I also found one. Here-}</p><br/><p>Jang Taeyoung abruptly turned his gaze.</p><br/><p>The hand tightly gripping his clothes fell away. The woman, who had followed behind him as though she would be in trouble if she didn\u2019t keep up, stood still with a pale-white face. As if she saw something terrifying.</p><br/><p>{Th-that person\u2026! It\u2019s him! The crazy guy I told you about!}</p><br/><p>Her trembling finger pointed at the man standing behind Lee Yeonwoo.</p><br/><p>{He killed people! We trapped him\u2026!}</p><br/><p>The moment the flustered Jang Taeyoung hesitated and the moment the man\u2019s lips curled upward, Lee Yeonwoo acted as quick as lightning. She threw the bag she was carrying and ran with just the child. She managed to take five steps by the time the man caught up and pulled her long hair. She let out a suppressed groan.</p><br/><p>{I wasn\u2019t crazy.}</p><br/><p>The man said, seeing their shocked faces.</p><br/><p>{Some things are inevitable in situations like this. That was all.}</p><br/><p>{Yeonwoo! You bastard! Let her go!}</p><br/><p>Jang Taeyoung finally overcame his shock and began running towards him.</p><br/><p>The man flung his bag. It smashed through the window in the hallway, and shards of glass fell. Lee Yeongwoo crouched her body. Seeing this, Jang Taeyoung stopped for a moment.</p><br/><p>The man snatched the child away from Lee Yeonwoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cUrrk. Urrk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s frightened cries leaked from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Grabbing the child by his collar and sitting on the window sill, the man said.</p><br/><p>{After being trapped in that cramped, damp, and dark place for so long\u2026 I feel like I might actually be crazy now. I feel suffocated like I\u2019m still in there.}</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t look angry.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t threatening or mocking them. At a glance, the man\u2019s expression seemed no different from before. He seemed calm like this was just a normal day. However, something was different. His voice, eyes, everything about him felt disturbing.</p><br/><p>The young woman, who had taken a few steps back, turned around and fled.</p><br/><p>The man looked outside the open window and mumbled.</p><br/><p>{How long will it take to go down to the first floor? Will 30 seconds do?}</p><br/><p>{What?}</p><br/><p>{I\u2019m throwing in 30 seconds. If you\u2019re quick, you should be able to catch him.}</p><br/><p>{Just what are you!}</p><br/><p>{One, two, three\u2026}</p><br/><p>The man began to count.</p><br/><p>When he reached seven, Lee Yeonwoo, who struggled as her hair was tightly held by the man, shouted.</p><br/><p>{Go! Mister, go quickly!}</p><br/><p>{Damn it!}</p><br/><p>Jang Taeyoung, who was hesitant, unsure whether he should charge at the man or run down, turned around with a distorted expression on his face. His footsteps quickly grew distant. The only ones remaining in the hallway was Lee Yeonwoo, the man, and the crying child with snot dripping from his nose.</p><br/><p>The man counted past 20.</p><br/><p>Lee Yeonwoo charged at him, clung to him, and even pleaded, but he didn\u2019t react to any of them. The man finally reached 30. And still, Jang Taeyoung hadn\u2019t come out of the building yet.</p><br/><p>The man said as if this was troublesome.</p><br/><p>{He runs slower than I expected.}</p><br/><p>{Don\u2019t do it. Wait, please wait a litt-!}</p><br/><p>Before Lee Yeonwoo could finish her words, he tossed the distressed, crying child out the window.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The marketing team employee, Kang Minjeong, took a few steps back.</p><br/><p>Only then did she take in her surroundings.</p><br/><p>The vision widened, and she heard someone gulp.</p><br/><p>She slowly moved her eyes.</p><br/><p>Director Choi Sungwon was looking at the monitor with shining eyes. The crinkling sounds of chip bags had stopped long ago. Even the actors who were talking with each other had shut their mouths.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the investors.</p><br/><p>They all looked entranced as they stared at the monitor like an audience staring at the screen in a dark theatre.</p><br/><p>Within this seemingly black and white scene, the only one moving was Chief Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>He observed people\u2019s reactions.</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong exhaled the breath she had been holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, about Mr. Nam Joyoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish he didn\u2019t have any interviews with reporters before the movie releases.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked back at her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Interviews?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are going to remove him from marketing material as well, and we won\u2019t put him in the trailer either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly, Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s lips curled upwards.</p><br/><p>Kang Minjeong gulped before saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat actor, I wish the audience met him for the first time on the big screen.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> No relation to the game.

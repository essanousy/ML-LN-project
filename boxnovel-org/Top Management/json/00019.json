Actually, getting hospitalized after getting hit would be better since then I could rest easy and not care about what other people thought. And get compensation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, do you think you\u2019ll be able to continue to work like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>That felt good, but those weren\u2019t my words.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, Hyunjo was walking towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to work fine, so you just care about your own future. Why are you here picking a fight with him, when you\u2019re the one who couldn\u2019t do his fucking job? Did he get that girl from Lemon Girls drunk and call the cops on her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Fuck, but still it\u2019s unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a funny bastard. What\u2019s unfair? There\u2019s a chance right in front of your eyes, would you let it go? Then that bastard\u2019s the idiot. Stop picking a fight with someone\u2019s who doing his job and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whoa\u2026 How did all that come from such a small body?</p><br/><p>Hyunjo\u2019s body was exactly half the size of Lemon Girls\u2019 manager. It looked like both his mind and body would break after a hit and he would be carried off on a stretcher. But, it was Lemon Girls\u2019 manager who was pressured by Hyunjo\u2019s spirit.</p><br/><p>Even though Lemon Girls\u2019 manager was panting heavily unable control his anger, he never swung his fists.</p><br/><p>Was the comment about the reporter effective?</p><br/><p>Anyways, we returned to the interview room. Behind us, the manager was still coldly glaring at us. Did we just add fuel to the fire\u2026 I didn\u2019t think it would end just like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like he\u2019s going to wear a hole in the back of my head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019ll attack us on our way home, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t even go home these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thaaanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut are you good at fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr good at sports? Like boxing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I am not friendly with sports.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen is your family incredibly rich? If you get hit once, will ten lawyers gather around you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry? There\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just what were you thinking provoking him like that? His body was like a boar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just be put down like that. That would be embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have more guts than I thought. Still, pick your opponents carefully from now on. If you care about getting embarrassed, something really might break.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued to nag for a while before adding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be hospitalized. You know we\u2019re busy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>My impression of him was good just a while ago, but he really was the Devil.</p><br/><p>Hyunjo continued after briefly looking behind us.</p><br/><p>\u201cEspecially don\u2019t get involved with him. He doesn\u2019t come from a good crowd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that as well. That rumors about him weren\u2019t good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just him, even his superiors are the same. Pure Star Entertainment itself is a company with plenty of dirty rumors. Nothing good will happen if you involve yourself with them, so it\u2019s best to avoid them.\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly stopped after nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas that manager just now from Pure Star Entertainment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You didn\u2019t know? Lemon Girls are Pure Star\u2019s group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe previous company Sung Dowon was in, that Pure Star?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Dowon suffered so much from them that he left as soon as his contract ended. At that time, Dowon was pretty much the bread winner of that company so they clung to him for a renewal\u2026 That\u2019s why there was some noise when he transferred to our company.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting this, but the dots were connecting.</p><br/><p>Just when I thought that, my vision went dark.</p><br/><p>Finally!</p><br/><p>If I could move, I would have cheered three times.</p><br/><p>I was in the office I could probably draw with my eyes closed. My office twenty years from now.</p><br/><p>Last time, in the future where I was sitting face to face with Dowon, the surroundings were hazy, but everything was clear this time. The situation was familiar. I was still sitting in the comfy chair and Director Park and Reporter Song were in front of me.</p><br/><p>Wow, Director Park\u2026 Now that I saw her again, I was certain she was Reporter Park Yoojeong.</p><br/><p>Although she had aged and her style has changed, her face was the same. But the fascinating thing was her face was definitely Reporter Park Yoojeong, but the feeling she gave off was completely different.</p><br/><p>Was it because of her age? People could even change to this degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, CEO originally wanted to be assigned to an actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Song opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>The content, of course, as well as the voice and expression, I concentrated on everything I could hear, see and feel.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you were working with Neptune, didn\u2019t you request to move to the actor team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right time to ask then. After I was hired, there was a huge incident within the actor team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just a little, just a little more specifically\u2026</p><br/><p>I was anxiously straining my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn incident?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSung Dowon\u2019s sex scandal.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s it!</p><br/><p>I was elated as soon as Sung Dowon\u2019s name was mentioned. The reason that his acting career could have been over was because of this sex scandal!</p><br/><p>Wait, but was that something that could end an actor\u2019s career? I could understand if he did drugs or gambled or received a DUI, but sex wasn\u2019t a crime. He would only lose a few of his fans from an incident like that.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it abnormal for someone with that face, that body and that paycheck to be abstinent?</p><br/><p>Was it not just a regular sex scandal? Did a video circulate?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that really was a mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park abruptly entered the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cA popular actor in his twenties, someone who was free of dating rumors, held a perverted sex party. Among them, there even was a married woman\u2026 Since a bomb like that exploded, at that time, it was an enormous scandal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh my god.</p><br/><p>\u201cArticles stating that woman was the wife of the president of a company who sponsored Dowon since the beginning or that Sung Dowon was a perverted sex addict started flooding in with a nonchalant attitude towards whether it was true or false. Well, even I wrote a bunch of articles then too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Director Park must have been met with backlash.\u201d</p><br/><p>My future self said with a smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Whew\u2026 It was war.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what was this backlash and what did she mean by war?</p><br/><p>I was so frustrated that my blood was about to flow in reverse when luckily Reporter Song asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by backlash?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that scandal. An unknown man used a newspaper company and asked W&amp;U and Song Dowon for a fortune. Adultery with a married woman, perverted sex, he said the public would rush to this topic and that if they wanted to quietly cover it up, they would have to pay him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man had a picture.\u201d</p><br/><p>A picture?</p><br/><p>\u201cA picture?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhoto evidence. So that\u2019s why W&amp;U paid the man to shut his mouth, but eventually an article popped up. The fact that W&amp;U tried to cover it with money and even that there was photo evidence. That\u2019s why Sung Dowon\u2019s image fell to the bottom in an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if that kind of scandal happened twenty years ago, it would have been huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sure was. However, not long after the situation reversed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe backlash started.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>My mind instantly snapped back.</p><br/><p>Hyunjo who was a few steps ahead of me called.</p><br/><p>What? Was that it? It\u2019s not like it was a shitty drama, did it really end like that?</p><br/><p>Even a shitty drama would tell you when the next episode was, but I didn\u2019t know when I would see this again.</p><br/><p>Are you telling me to die of frustration?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll go in in a sec.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Come in once you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>I exited the studio with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>I paced in front of the studio for a long while to calm myself.</p><br/><p>Good. Let\u2019s think optimistically.</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t have my foresight ability, I wouldn\u2019t have known anything. However, now I knew that Sung Dowon will be caught in the worst sex scandal and that his image would drop to the floor. Also, although I didn\u2019t know why, that the situation would reverse.</p><br/><p>When they said backlash, it would\u2019ve meant that other circumstances came up as well, which meant that there was something that could reverse Sung Dowon\u2019s predicament.</p><br/><p>And the anonymous man W&amp;U made a deal with\u2026</p><br/><p>Why did Pure Star Entertainment make me feel uneasy?</p><br/><p>Dowon definitely said that \u2018he would have been caught in their trap.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although it was only a hunch, let\u2019s think through it once.</p><br/><p>Since Sung Dowon was pretty much the bread winner for Pure Star Entertainment, when he refused to renew his contract, they must have been very pissed. During the time they were grinding their teeth at W&amp;U and Sung Dowon, their girl group, Lemon Girls, blew off a big chance after a big incident.</p><br/><p>But, of all people, it was W&amp;U\u2019s Neptune who grabbed that chance, so Pure Star Entertainment must have been more pissed.</p><br/><p>So as a way of saying fuck you, they planned a trap for Sung Dowon\u2026</p><br/><p>Something like that?</p><br/><p>Since Sung Dowon was with Pure Star Entertainment since his debut, there was a high probability that they knew a lot about Sung Dowon\u2019s personal life, even the finer details. Although I didn\u2019t know how much of the sex scandal was true, they could have taken a picture that could be used against him later in secret.</p><br/><p>Did they anonymously approach W&amp;U because they didn\u2019t want to face them head on?</p><br/><p>Or were they scared that Sung Dowon wouldn\u2019t suffer by himself and blab about them?</p><br/><p>They said that even the fact they paid him was revealed to the public. They also knew that these kinds of backdoor deals would stain W&amp;U and Sung Dowon\u2019s image even more and since they kept their anonymity, they could just sit back and enjoy the show.</p><br/><p>Well, it was still only an assumption.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-18\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 18\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-20\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 20\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201150\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

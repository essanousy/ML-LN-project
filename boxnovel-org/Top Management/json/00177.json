You feel about getting rejected by Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the riding experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while feeling the plush massage chair. I had ridden in those commonly known as \u2018celebrity vans\u2019 as a manager, but this was the best I\u2019ve been in. It didn\u2019t smell of food or dusty, and it was as comfortable as a cozy loft.</p><br/><p>If I had something like this, Lee Songha would be less exhausted during overnight shoots.</p><br/><p>I looked around the van before meeting Chief Lee Janghyun\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem calm to have to leisure to judge the driving experience on your way to Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though it was a disaster area.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun wrinkled his nose like he was trying not to snort.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour head\u2019s going to fly if you approach her like you would Lee Songha. If Lee Songha\u2019s a flowery mountain, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s a minefield. There\u2019s no countdown. She\u2019ll just explode. She wasn\u2019t this bad before, but she\u2019s become crazy after her contract renewal. Fuck, even I\u2019ve become crazy. Suffering this shit because I said I could manage her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to have suffered quite the hardship to swear like that. I had heard there was a chief from Team 2 who clung to the Team 2 Leader\u2019s ankles, saying that he couldn\u2019t take it any longer, after volunteering to handle Son Chaeyoung. Was it him?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, anyways. There isn\u2019t anyone who\u2019s gotten used to Son Chaeyoung as quick as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you some tips, so remember what I do. Only then will you be able to talk to Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>He acted like he was being very considerate of me with every remark.</p><br/><p>What was he planning?</p><br/><p>The majority of times people made a move against me pissed me off, but occasionally, it was interesting. This was the latter. His gaze was thorny when we met in the outdoor smoking area.</p><br/><p>Well, it seemed like he was helping me because he wanted something from me.</p><br/><p>He seemed to notice I was examining him as he coughed. Then he checked his pockets. Amongst the miscellaneous items such as cigarettes, lighter, and name card, he took out a piece of gum. He quickly blew a bubble after putting the gum in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople who don\u2019t know think that managers who chew gum look like thugs, but a lot of baseball players chew gum too. It helps release some of your tension. It\u2019ll be helpful if actors had some before a shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun glanced at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut about Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy because you\u2019re already taking care of so many people. Isn\u2019t that why you hastily found a temporary manager for Nam Joyoon? You\u2019ll be even busier with Son Chaeyoung, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to handle all of Lee Songha\u2019s schedule by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aha, Lee Songha?</p><br/><p>I was wonder what he was aiming for by acting so considerate.</p><br/><p>Who he really wanted to make a move on was Lee Songha and I was just the bridge to her?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who usually fills in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI try my best to take care of Songha\u2019s schedule myself. Kwanwoo or Chief Kim Hyunjo fills in when I really can\u2019t make it. If they are both busy, then our team leader fills in sometimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what if the Team 3 Leader is busy? Why it seemed like he was busy with Blackout\u2019s overseas concerts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem interested in our team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, even if we aren\u2019t in the same team, we are all part of the same family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen even the Team 3 Leader can\u2019t fill in, I adjust her schedule\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun cut in hastily,</p><br/><p>\u201cHave some free time. Jungkyun, who I\u2019m managing right now, is going to mandatory military service soon. If you don\u2019t have someone to fill in for you for Lee Songha\u2019s schedule, then I think I can help you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Desire was visible in his voice and on his face.</p><br/><p>I covered my smirk with a laugh.</p><br/><p>I felt it again. That unpleasant feeling. While it wasn\u2019t as bad as with CEO Baek Hansung, it wasn\u2019t so light that I could simply ignore it. Was a switch flipped? There were countless people who wanted Lee Songha, what was I supposed to do if it made me feel unpleasant?</p><br/><p>How troublesome.</p><br/><p>I hid my inner thoughts and made a fake business smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely ask when that happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though it never will.</p><br/><p>The van stopped its drive around a luxurious residential area. When thinking about Son Chaeyoung, I imagined a white house on top of a hill, but her real house was a private house like ones you saw in dramas.<sup>{1}</sup> I didn\u2019t know if it was to protect her private life, but the wall around her house was as tall as a fortress. Ivy covered the red brick wall, and plenty of trees shot up above the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a little. I\u2019m going to call her. Her phone should be on now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun called her. As he said, Son Chaeyoung\u2019s phone seemed to be on because I could hear it ring. He shrugged as if he was showing off.</p><br/><p>10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute. She still didn\u2019t pick up.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun hung up and called her again.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe normally answers after five tries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive tries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, and if you wait in the van for a long while. Ah, she doesn\u2019t let other people into her home. If you wait in the van, she\u2019ll open the door at the exact time we need to leave. Even if she doesn\u2019t care about anything else, she follows her schedule to a tee. That\u2019s why you need to have a schedule if you want to talk to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t answer the second time. I asked on his third attempt,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why do you come so early? You just need to come at the exact time for her schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really, that\u2019s not it. Even if she followed her schedule to a tee until yesterday, she might decide not to today. You can\u2019t assume or predict Son Chaeyoung\u2019s actions. They aren\u2019t correct. You don\u2019t even know this. Without me, you would have had your head against the wall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>This felt like I returned to when I was a new recruit.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. She\u2019s going to answer now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun made his fifth attempt.</p><br/><p>His phone rang\u2026 continuously.</p><br/><p>Taken aback, he tried to look over the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she answering? She should be answering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou definitely can\u2019t assume or predict her actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, why is she acting like this on the day I came to get her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t answer on his sixth and seventh attempt either.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun rubbed his face and groaned.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, wait. I\u2019ll try to ask Chief Jo for help\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try calling her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said, taking my phone out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Chief Jo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ms. Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, go for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was on the phone with Chief Jo, I tried calling Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>I was waiting for it to ring when I suddenly heard a voice.</p><br/><p>-What is it?</p><br/><p>What the heck? Was she holding her phone?</p><br/><p>I simply flinched because this happened before, but Chief Lee Janghyun turned his head so quickly he almost hit his nose on his headrest.</p><br/><p>-What is it? Am I on speaker like last time?</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Then why did you call me? Did you see someone like me on the street?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019m in front of your house right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice paused. When I checked my phone, she had already hung up.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun asked with a flustered expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? What did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe just hung up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then I\u2019ll try calling her again. She might have picked up because she thought it was me. Well, since she picked up, she\u2019ll probably come out if we wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was saying with a mix of relief and bitterness when the door suddenly opened.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung came out and looked around. This was the only car waiting outside. Son Chaeyoung came over. I checked her hands for a knife or something. That was how murderous her aura was.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun made weird gestures before almost rolling out of the van. I got off after him. Stopping in her tracks, Son Chaeyoung crossed her arms. Then her gaze alternated between Chief Lee Janghyun and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Chaeyoung!\u201d</p><br/><p>He finally seemed to come to his senses as Chief Lee Janghyun approached her in a friendly manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already done getting ready\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have some business with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied because I thought she was asking me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of business?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour next project. This issue has been handed to me, so I was hoping to talk to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, fu-!\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung stomped the ground. Chief Lee Janghyun quickly two steps away from me like there was a landmine. Son Chaeyoung glared at him before looking back at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in. I think it\u2019ll get loud.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun suddenly raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? In your house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the police might come if we talk outside. Are you okay with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun gave me a sympathetic look. He continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I come in..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung cut him off with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying for some ripe persimmons. Can you buy me some?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRipe persimmons? Persimmons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun\u2019s mouth gaped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t persimmons ripen in the fall? How can I find that this early spring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I knew, I would have already bought some. Do you think I\u2019d be waiting until I\u2019m dying for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to eat them all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s morning sickness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I look at Son Chaeyoung\u2019s belly in shock\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Chaeyoung! You can\u2019t say stuff like that in public! What if it becomes a rumor\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Do you think I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not joking, then\u2026! Do-don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Janghyun\u2019s gaze fell on Son Chaeyoung\u2019s flat belly that was covered by her loose shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking. But I\u2019m serious about the ripe persimmons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said in a temperamental fashion. After sending Chief Lee Janghyun off did she go back in her house. Her steps were so fierce that I felt like their vibrations could even reach me. I massaged my neck as I entered behind her. As expected, this wasn\u2019t something I could do for a long time.</p><br/><p>Her living room was multiple times bigger than my apartment. Her photos were hung up on the walls. They weren\u2019t from a photoshoot but were rather stills from her projects. From back when she was a child actress to Mermaid out of Water. This place didn\u2019t feel like a home, instead, it was closer to a gallery filled with all of Son Chaeyoung\u2019s acting roles.</p><br/><p>My attention focused on them momentarily. Enough that I forgot about Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. How can you focus on something else in this situation? What are you looking at!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe photos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at them after we talk! Don\u2019t you remember what I told you before? Are you a goldfish?\u201d</p><br/><p>The goldfish were somewhere else.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to refuse no matter what. I told you to say that you won\u2019t be my manager!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember answering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to listen to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung huffed like this was ridiculous.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d offer me a seat, so I leaned against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a proper explanation and it wasn\u2019t a request either. Is there a reason why I should listen to whatever you say? Rather, the CEO offered proper compensation with this request. That\u2019s why I decided to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompensation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung fiercely came up to me. Her eyes, which emitted sparks, were right in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the CEO say he\u2019ll give you? How enticing was it for someone as stuck up as you to come see me? When you said that you weren\u2019t interested in me and had no plans of driving me in your van? You acted like someone with a single-minded obsession, yet does your head churn because he wags some compensation in front of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe CEO asked me to persuade you into doing another project. I\u2019m not becoming your manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>I would have refused if it was something like that. Why would I want to see more of your unsightly appearance?</p><br/><p>It had only been five minutes since we\u2019ve met, yet I\u2019ve already started to regret it. The sweet compensation CEO Baek Hansung offered and the vision I had seen twice began to blur. Staying with Son Chaeyoung made my soul feel like it was growing moldy.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung frowned. Her glossy lips twisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what to do? I\u2019m sorry, no, I\u2019m not sorry, but I have no plans on choosing my next project no matter what you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. I don\u2019t plan on doing anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied with a shrug. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s eyelashes flickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, I think I should at least act like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Act like what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been half a day since I told the CEO, director, and the Team 2 Leader that I would try to persuade you, so I should at least look like I\u2019m trying. Image what would happen to my image if I gave up right away. Well, if you change your mind and choose your next project in the meantime, that\u2019s better for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? You\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>My phone began to ring as Son Chaeyoung yelled.</p><br/><p>It was from Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>As soon as I checked her name, Son Chaeyoung, who was right in front of me, saw her name as well.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung laughed cunningly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Lee Songha know that you\u2019re here acting like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her outstretched hand aimed for my phone like a hawk striking at its prey. However, she missed. When I raised my phone above my head, Son Chaeyoung huffed,</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, you\u2019re quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had quadruplets who acted like that. Even they didn\u2019t act like this since entering elementary school. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was speaking, Son Chaeyoung was staring at my phone. As if it had become my weakness. The phone continued to vibrate. I took two to three steps away from Son Chaeyoung before answering the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> \u2018White house on top of a hill\u2019 usually refers to a psychiatric hospital.</p></div></header><br/>\n</p></div>"}

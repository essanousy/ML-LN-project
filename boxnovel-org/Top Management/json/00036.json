Unless they film everything beforehand, it\u2019s certain that they\u2019ll film later episodes during the project\u2019s release, and the problem is whether she\u2019ll be able to endure it or not. They say even writers who have written a few projects start to lose it when they don\u2019t have enough time and start writing 1 or 2-page screenplays.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly threw in some additional information.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if the writer is new, someone like Producer Shin Taekyun has the capability to lead them through it. I looked into it and apparently, TVL looked at the screenplay for a few episodes before green-lighting the project right away. Since the viewership ratings for TVL\u2019s dramas, which had cast top stars, flopped, and many ended early, they probably planned this out carefully. Since they saw the potential, they greenlit this project and assigned Producer Shin Taekyun, who has proven directing abilities and a box office track record, to this project.\u201d</p><br/><p>To find any information that would be of use in persuading them, I had used my spare time, which I didn\u2019t have much of, to research. I even acted as a potential sponsor and asked TVL\u2019s advertising department and the production producer<sup>[1]</sup> at Pan Production a few questions. It felt like I was filming a spy movie.</p><br/><p>I hope this would help even a little bit.</p><br/><p>I felt my heart thumping as I waited for their reaction when Kim Hyunjo asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you receive something from them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not they asked for a different actor, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d give you something to get Songha. Why are you pushing this project so desperately?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader scratched his angled chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must have come to really like it while he was researching about it. You know, there are occasionally times like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but he\u2019s suspicious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched and let out a fake cough while turning away.</p><br/><p>This time, the team 3 leader turned to look at Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you, Songha? Do you like this project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whew, I lived.</p><br/><p>I let out a sigh of relief. There was a huge difference in weight between me and Songha, who would be the one taking the audition, pushing this project.</p><br/><p>While there were managers who would ignore their actor\u2019s opinions and bully them into doing whatever the company told them to do, that wasn\u2019t Kim Hyunjo or the team 3 leader\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? The synopsis should be pretty good then. Then let\u2019s read it once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCat Guardian Ghost? The title is like a comic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two flipped through each page of the synopsis.</p><br/><p>Looking at them, I thought\u2026 it felt very similar to that day I showed my mom a flunked test and was waiting for her punishment.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader and Kim Hyunjo\u2019s expressions turned gloomier as time passed.</p><br/><p>Of course, I understood why. How many people would read that synopsis and think that that it would be a success? If there was someone else besides me who was certain that it would be a success, I would definitely be suspicious that he possessed a foresight ability as well.</p><br/><p>I mean it was a synopsis, the draft of your project, would it kill you to package it better? I even began to resent Pan Production\u2019s CEO, Kim Pansuk, and Writer Hong Jumi.</p><br/><p>Flip.</p><br/><p>They flipped the last page. Kim Hyunjo covered the synopsis and sighed. Then, a suffocating silence hung in the air for a few moments.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo broke the silence and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what do I think. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour thoughts are the same as mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo stared at both Lee Songha and myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking because I\u2019m really curious, but why do you like this? Did you pick a project that you thought you would have a higher chance at getting cast in because you won\u2019t be cast for other projects? If not, I don\u2019t really understand? Songha, what do you like about this synopsis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stared vacantly at Kim Hyunjo and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo sighed once more.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What I\u2019m saying is, why, how is this fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like the role of Jung Haewon. I\u2019m also curious what will happen next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re curious, you can just watch it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t be persuaded like that!</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026 I want to try it. If I\u2019m going to audition, I like this role, oppa. I like this, team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, it seemed Lee Songha was determined. She clearly expressed her opinion while looking at the team leader.</p><br/><p>I fully prepared a reply as well. Damn, my heart felt like a rollercoaster for some time now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuck Thrower, how about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo was about to ask before he narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. Don\u2019t say anything if you\u2019re going to bring up your senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenses?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the team 3 leader felt something was odd, Kim Hyunjo gestured at me with his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, he rejected Sung Dowon because of bad vibes. I can\u2019t trust his senses anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to bring that up once we were done talking about Songha\u2026 bad vibes? You get stranger the more I see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Should I have not said anything about my senses?</p><br/><p>They talked between each other with me as their topic and soon, Kim Hyunjo asked me again,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, why are you so stubborn about this project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I think this is a good project. And that\u2019s why I showed it to Songha. I watched all the director\u2019s previous works, and he is very good at directing. Although the synopsis is a bit bland, I felt that it was well-written.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I heard this from the future.</p><br/><p>When I recalled how the PR team\u2019s employee said that \u2018the script was everything,\u2019 and \u2018the drama was the writer\u2019s playground\u2019, I assumed it was okay to believe that the fact that the script was good was a fact. Also, TVL\u2019s drama department employees wouldn\u2019t have greenlit a low-quality screenplay from a new writer.</p><br/><p>Even I would have hesitated about putting Lee Songha in this project if the drama succeeded due to the actors or another complicated reason.</p><br/><p>Since I may change the future by putting Lee Songha in there.</p><br/><p>However, if it was a drama that became a hit because of its screenplay, I judged that the drama wouldn\u2019t fail because one of its supporting actors was switched out. Unless that actor was so terrible at acting that the quality of the drama fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s see the screenplay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader nodded his head and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHyunjo, you go get the screenplay. If the screenplay\u2019s good, let\u2019s look into getting an audition. No matter how much you like it, it\u2019s better to audition for a role you would be good at. It will increase your chance at getting cast, and it will be easier to understand the character if you do get cast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 okay. Still, you never know, so Songha, you read other synopses as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo nodded his head then clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, that CEO of Pan Production is quite frustrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Frustrating?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said this is his first project after becoming independent from TVL. Then he must be using all his connections for this, but why would he take the risk with a new writer? It would be safer if he used an experienced one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, I was curious as well.</p><br/><p>I knew that Writer Hong Jumi was skilled so I wasn\u2019t worried about it flopping, but with what confidence did CEO Kim Pansuk decide to use a new writer for their first project that would decide the future of their production?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople are probably saying I\u2019m insane, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was the CEO of Pan Production. Kim Pansuk mumbled with his large figure squeezed into a small metal chair. The production producer, Park Sookyung, who was sitting in front of him and looking at his laptop screen, fixed his glasses and glanced at him.</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk\u2019s eyes were shaking uneasily.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, still, just wait until the first episode is released. When they see it, I know they\u2019ll be like, \u2018Ah, so that\u2019s why Kim Pansuk brought a new writer in for this critical time\u2019. I\u2019m not uneasy in the slightest. There\u2019s no reason to be. Since I believe in Writer Hong Jumi\u2019s skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, if you\u2019re not uneasy, then please stop shaking your leg. My laptop is shaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>When CEO Kim Pansuk, who possessed a threatening figure, widened his eyes and stared at him. Park Sookyung stealthily avoided his gaze.</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk groaned as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this fails, I\u2019m screwed. I used all my personal connections on this project. If this fails, I don\u2019t have a second chance. It\u2019ll be good, right? The screenplay is good, and even though Shin Taekyun, that bastard, looks a little flimsy, his skills are certain. Right? It\u2019ll be good, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor someone who\u2019s the production producer, you don\u2019t have confidence in your project? Worrying is something I, who pays the salaries, do, and you should be working with the certainty that it\u2019ll be good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This project will be really good. It will be a hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hit? We can\u2019t even cast our leading roles!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That moment, they heard a knock, and two people came in.</p><br/><p>Writer Hong Jumi, who looked to be about half the size of CEO Kim Pansuk, and Director Shin Taekyun, a man with messy hair like a bird\u2019s nest who looked to be in his thirties.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, senior<sup>[2]</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO\u2026 we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Director Shin. Writer Hong. Welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk quickly crossed his legs and said calmly. After saying hello to Park Sookyung, Writer Hong Jumi sat down and wriggled her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 I heard some loud noises from outside, is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The screenplay is great; what problems would we have? Writer Hong, you don\u2019t need to worry at all, just trust me and follow along. Just write good screenplays from now on. Screenplays. Is the next episode done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The first draft is done, and I was revising it together with the director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile the screenplays are fine; the problem is the cast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Shin scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are creating a fuss up there, telling me to quickly cast people. If we keep pushing casting back, we might lose the green light.\u201d</p><br/><p>At his words, the expressions of the people gathered in the meeting room grew dark.</p><br/><p>Park Sookyung let out a sigh and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll because Lim Joowon fell through\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, what can we do when he\u2019s hurt? We were rejected by Kim Yeonsung and Park Hyemin. There are so many actors in Korea, but are there none who will be our lead? We need to quickly find a lead so we can cast our supporting roles as well\u2026 Should we lower our standards a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Shin shook his head at CEO Kim Pansuk\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe project from GTBN that\u2019s running at the same time as us, they apparently got Kim Yeonsung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That Big Bear Production or something?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Because of that, the guys up there are telling us to cast someone at Kim Yeonsung\u2019s level. Even if they leave the projects from the three public TV networks out of the discussion, they said they didn\u2019t want to fall behind GTBN, their competitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKim Yeonsung, that guy, said he wouldn\u2019t do cable dramas, but he went there? How did Big Bear get him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c40 million won<sup>[3]</sup> per episode. They said they\u2019d pay in advance once he signed the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c40 million per episode and it\u2019s a 20-episode project\u2026 that\u2019s 800 million won. They spent that right away? They have that much money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey probably calculated overseas selling rights and other stuff and thought that giving him 800 million in advance was still worth it since he quite well received in China.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Pansuk was about to grab his forehead when he became conscious of Writer Hong Jumi and simply coughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Our screenplay is good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say the other side\u2019s screenplay is good as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Sookyung mumbled.</p><br/><p>While the atmosphere of the meeting room had turned suffocating and heavy, the door opened, accompanied by a knock.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, CEO.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest producer of Pan Production\u2019s production department hesitated before coming in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe received a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a meeting\u2026 Haa, where is it from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW&amp;U.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk paused.</p><br/><p>\u201cW&amp;U?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one with CEO Baek Hansung? That W&amp;U with Sung Dowon, Park Sohyun, and Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, yes. I think that is the one.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Kim Pansuk kicked his chair as he abruptly stood up.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>[1] </sup>I read this in a Korean news article, but apparent some larger productions divide producers into planning, organization, production and direction roles, which is probably why Producer Shin Taekyun is the drama\u2019s director.</p><br/><p><sup>[2] </sup>I try to use English alternatives when I can. I don\u2019t know if you prefer \u2018sunbae\u2019 or \u2018senior\u2019.</p><br/><p><sup>[3]</sup> ~34892 USD</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-35\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 35\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-37\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 37\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201184\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

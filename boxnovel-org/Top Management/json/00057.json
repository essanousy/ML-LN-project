Looking at how only her pupils slid downwards in her widened eyes, it seemed she couldn\u2019t grasp the situation and what had hit her face.</p><br/><p>The tiramisu cake, still a black mess stuck onto her face, slowly slid down.</p><br/><p>While taking in the once in a lifetime scene in front of me, I thought for a moment.</p><br/><p>Although the cake I spent a lot of money on became like that, I didn\u2019t feel like the money was wasted.</p><br/><p>The cake choice was great. If it was simply a cream cake, then I thought it would feel slightly lacking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what, th-this, Chae-Chaeyoung\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo\u2019s stutter broke the silence. He stared at me then at Lee Songha with the pale face of someone who had watched a terrifying horror movie before rummaging through his pockets and hurriedly disappearing, saying that he would bring tissues.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said as she wiped her cheek with the back of her hand and furiously brushed off the cakey mess. I thought she would rampage like a beast like before, but perhaps it was similar to the quiet before the storm as her voice was unexpectedly calm.</p><br/><p>However, there was a vicious look in her eyes.</p><br/><p>I raised my arm and shielded Lee Songha just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, I became surprised. Her voice was as calm as usual, but her eyes seemed to be burning. Her attitude seemed as though, if Son Chaeyoung raised her hand again, she\u2019d throw the cake box at her too.</p><br/><p>Well, she was like that. I had forgotten for a while.</p><br/><p>I had forgotten that Lee Songha, who would become dejected whenever she troubled her team because of her mistakes, was the type who would say what she wanted and fight when necessary.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who started it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung laughed as if taken aback. Lee Songha didn\u2019t care and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou tried to hit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Did he get hit? He dodged it like a slippery eel. Also, because I vented my anger on your manager, you throw a cake at your company senior? Have you lost your mind because people praise you for being a genius? Do you think that you can still-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t vent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha cut her off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t vent your anger on someone else\u2019s-\u201c</p><br/><p>Someone else\u2019s?</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone else\u2019s oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like she had hurriedly changed her words.</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t have the chance to be curious. Behind Son Chaeyoung, the door opened again. Then the still pale-faced Chief Jo glanced outside before entering then closing the door.</p><br/><p>He had a bunch of tissues in one hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung, before anyone sees you, you sho-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, is someone seeing me the problem? When I was hit with a cake?\u201d</p><br/><p>She spat after snatching the tissues. Chief Jo did a double take before looking at Lee Songha with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you thi-!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Chief Jo\u2019s expression soon became bitter. It was clear he was also aware that Son Chaeyoung requested Teacher Shim Kyungtaek to block Lee Songha\u2019s path. That was why he couldn\u2019t scold her. When thinking of what Son Chaeyoung did, she deserved a rock thrown at her, let alone a cake.</p><br/><p>Instead of Lee Songha, Chief Jo picked on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you! How could you just watch instead of stopping her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it as I was thinking about Teacher Shim Kyungtaek.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo flinched like someone who had been suddenly attacked at my words. As if this sight irritated her, Son Chaeyoung angrily threw the tissues she was wiping her face with on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m pissed. Don\u2019t think about picking on Teacher Shim with this incident. I heard that you now know everything. I did it. I asked the teacher to stop Lee Songha from acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung!\u201d</p><br/><p>Frightened, Chief Jo checked outside.</p><br/><p>I momentarily halted. Although Teacher Shim Kyungtaek told me everything, I never thought that Son Chaeyoung would admit it with her own mouth as if it was nothing.</p><br/><p>I suddenly became worried and looked at Lee Songha. However, Lee Songha was less agitated than before. She simply stared at Son Chaeyoung with eyes that seemed calm and deep like a bottomless pool of water.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t tell what she was thinking with those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what are you going to do about it now that you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you going to whine to? The director? The CEO? Try it. What do you think the CEO is going to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChaeyoung, really, what if someone hears you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chief Jo grabbed her arm and tried to stop her, Son Chaeyoung raised her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one besides these two anyways! And what did I do wrong?! I only hid it because it was embarrassing, do you think I hid it because I was scared?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. Haa, you clearly told the team leader you wouldn\u2019t do it aga-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did it because I didn\u2019t like her. When I thought that she might join my project, I became so irritated that I couldn\u2019t read the script or sleep! I made so much money for the company, they can just gloss it over with that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even her assigned manager, Chief Jo, seemed flabbergasted. Although he was looking at Son Chaeyoung like a moving bomb, Son Chaeyoung didn\u2019t stop and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I became relaxed, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there was nothing getting in my way, I became relaxed and didn\u2019t get stressed. Because of that, the drama went well and so did the movie. I did so many commercials and advertisements last year too. Do you think that she\u2019d make more than me even if she continued acting? In the company\u2019s perspective, wasn\u2019t this better?\u201d</p><br/><p>My anger surged, calmed, was taken aback, then calmed again.</p><br/><p>There was one thing on my mind now.</p><br/><p>Just where did someone like her come from?</p><br/><p>It was like I was looking into Son Chayoung the human and not the actress. When you took off her clean, innocent fabricated fa\u00e7ade, there was an obscure, disgusting monster inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for my reply, she said sarcastically,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere not much time before I have to renew my contract. That is why the director and CEO aren\u2019t going to say anything to me right now. From the drama releasing in January to extending commercial and advertising contracts, there\u2019s a lot riding on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, so this was it. This was what Teacher Shim Kyungtaek meant.</p><br/><p>That it would be better if I had just glossed over it without knowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the CEO asks me to apologize, then, well, I\u2019ll think about it. So, until then, don\u2019t piss someone off with something like this. It seems you don\u2019t know because it hasn\u2019t been long since you\u2019ve started working, but this industry is always like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>I swallow the countless words that surged up my throat and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it hasn\u2019t been long since I\u2019ve started working, there something I clearly learned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething you learned?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung, who had a mocking smile, narrowed her eyes.</p><br/><p>I looked at Lee Songha. She was still standing tall behind me.</p><br/><p>However, I could feel her thin fingers clinging on my shirt.</p><br/><p>Although I might not know the ways of the world, I wasn\u2019t simply a na\u00efve person. Meaning, I wasn\u2019t the type to completely believe CEO Baek Hansung would make Son Chaeyoung pay a worthy price for her actions after listening to her words.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t naivety but stupidity.</p><br/><p>This industry was a breeding ground of absurdity and irrationality. There was nothing more to say about this as this was a celebrity management organization with an enormous food chain of boss-subordinate relationships.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung was a top actress residing in the upper echelon, while Lee Songha and I were buried way below, to the point where it would be difficult to see us, and were only now sticking our heads out and looking up towards the top.</p><br/><p>However, because I was in this position, I could say this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou never know what will happen the very next day in this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and the team 3 leader arrived long after the appointed time.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader\u2019s expression stiffened after checking the cake on the meeting room floor and the cocoa powder still stuck on Son Chaeyoung\u2019s neck. When the two of them entered, Son Chaeyoung clicked her tongue as if they were a hindrance.</p><br/><p>Then she bobbed her head in greeting to the team 3 leader and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the team 3 leader called out to her, Son Chaeyoung momentarily stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something we can just gloss over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tiresome to say the same thing multiple times. Please talk with my team leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said with a smile before disappearing without turning back. Chief Jo followed behind while reading at the team 3 leader\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and the team 3 leader shook their heads. They both revealed the same expression I had on previously. An expression that said, \u2018Just where did someone like her come from?\u2019</p><br/><p>I, once again, thought that the influence of a top star was quite amazing and that, if I didn\u2019t want to see such dirty figures in this industry, I needed to at least have the title of a CEO.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow ill-mannered. She\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader sat in an empty seat and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Shim Kyungtaek, that damn bastard, called the team 2 leader. He fumed about how you crossed the line or whatever so we were late because we got in a dispute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looked like he was going to grind you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo added with a frown.</p><br/><p>Since I already became an eyesore to the team 2 leader after the Sung Dowon incident, with this, it seemed that I had crossed a point of no return. Well, I had no thoughts on turning things around for this incident.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader tapped my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about. I firmly told the team 2 leader that I told you to do it and to not even think about letting his temper out on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare he try to vent his anger out on someone else after being stabbed in the back? He should have taken better care of his people. If it were me, I would be too embarrassed to show my face.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the team 3 leader continued to grumble, Kim Hyunjo tapped the table and changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile both hyung and I have listened to the audio file, tell us from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still aware of Lee Songha, who was sitting next to me, I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>From the incident with Shim Kyungtaek in the morning, to the incident just now. As I told the events which took place while taking out the unnecessary bits and emphasizing others, Kim Hyunjo and the team 3 leader\u2019s expressions progressively turned uglier. The only one who remained calm was Lee Songha, the person this concerned.</p><br/><p>No, at this point, she surpassed calmness and approached the boundaries of imperturbability.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the two who showed intense reactions at each word, using swears I hadn\u2019t even heard of before, became rampant like angry bulls when they heard the part when Son Chaeyoung mentioned the director and the CEO.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to wickedness. At this point, she\u2019s just a crazy bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, you should have thrown the table at her instead of the cake,\u201d</p><br/><p>Added Kim Hyunjo. I deeply agreed with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, how much longer is it until Son Chaeyoung\u2019s contract renewal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact date, but since they made a 2-year exclusive contract last time, there isn\u2019t much time left. That\u2019s why the team 2 leader was busy since last month, trying to curry favor with Son Chaeyoung. Even Team Leader Park from the PR team was exhausted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the director and the CEO will really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said while glancing at Lee Songha. He was worried that the director and the CEO would really gloss over this for the contract renewal like Son Chaeyoung said.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a 1-person company for Son Chaeyoung, she needs to take responsibility for her actions. This goes the same for that Shim Kyungtaek bastard. When I investigated, it looked like there were previous cases before Songha as well. I\u2019ll call the director and the CEO and discuss it with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two talked for a while before each saying a word of encouragement to Lee Songha and getting up. Since they left with murderous looks, it looked like their target was either Chief Jo or the team 2 leader.</p><br/><p>I was also about to leave, but I kept thinking of the disaster in the meeting room.</p><br/><p>I rolled up my sleeves and wiped the cake plastered everywhere. Lee Songha, who was next to me, helping me clean up with tissues, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI threw the cake you bought me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she looked at the cake dropped under the table as if it was a waste.</p><br/><p>Although she knew her life had almost been twisted by Son Chaeyoung\u2019s wickedness, the words she said with a serious expression were\u2026 I wanted to open her head and see what kind of thoughts were contained in that small head of hers. It was this moment when I felt it was a pity my ability wasn\u2019t mind reading.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was only able to take one bite, but it was incredibly tasty. It was expensive, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you did well to throw it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The price didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good since it was worthwhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned when I recalled Son Chaeyoung\u2019s face plastered with cake. It seemed Lee Songha recalled the same thing as her lips curved slightly upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think it was a waste. I\u2019ll buy you one that\u2019s bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she picked up the tissues and placed them in the cake box, she said in a passing tone,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat witch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I work hard and become successful, can I drive her out far away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after I took Lee Songha to her residence and went home, her last words kept ringing in my ears.</p><br/><p>Her words asking if she could drive Son Chaeyoung far away.</p><br/><p>Although she said it in a passing tone, the more I thought about it, the heavier her words felt.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking about it, slouched on my desk, my phone rang.</p><br/><p>It was a number I was seeing for the first time.</p><br/><p>Well, it seemed by phone number became public since broadcast writers and entertainment reporters would call me all day and night so I was used unknown numbers now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Umm. Are you free to talk?</p><br/><p>Whoa.</p><br/><p>I hurriedly turned the phone, which was against my ear, and confirmed the phone number.</p><br/><p>Did I ever see this number on my company\u2019s list of phone numbers?</p><br/><p>He sounded like CEO Baek Hansung.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, are you the CEO\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-Right. I called you because I wanted to ask you something.</p><br/><p>I heard a low laughter from the other side.</p><br/><p>That moment, I suddenly recalled what CEO Baek Hansung said to me privately in his office.</p><br/><p>What to give me if the drama is a success.</p><br/><p>If there was something I wanted, to tell him then.</p><br/><p>I straightened my back and said while sitting,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m free to talk. I also\u2026 have something I would like to tell you.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> The reason she reacts like this is because Lee Songha didn\u2019t refer to her as her senior.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-56\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 56\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-58\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 58\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201227\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

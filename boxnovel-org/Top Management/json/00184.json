His honest face was filled with confusion. I felt sorry.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t like it was unexpected. He had expected that his brother, who had thrown his private life away for work for the past few years, had finally found himself a woman, but after hearing the situation, it was difficult to tell whether this was more of a therapist session than asking for relationship advice.</p><br/><p>I laughed bitterly and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for giving you a headache. You were the only one I could talk to about this. I did think about receiving counselling, but it\u2019s a bit difficult when your face is known to the public.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be sorry. This is what family is for.\u201d</p><br/><p>My brother waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s assume that you and Ms. Songha are dating.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice, which became quiet when he said her name, grew in volume again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s assume you are dating with no issues involving the public eye, your careers, the company, or anything else. There\u2019s no chance you\u2019ll break up nor is there a chance your great relationship will worsen. If you want, you can even get married and have a great life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a great assumption.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just on the personal level. Instead, Ms. Songha doesn\u2019t work with you any longer and works with someone else. Whether she changes her manager or she goes to a different company. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did I think?</p><br/><p>If someone besides me helped expand Lee Songha\u2019s filmography, strove for the same goal, and got her on the red carpet?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can allow that.\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice was cold.</p><br/><p>I wished it would stop here, but my brother continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if Ms. Songha wants to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>A black scarf fluttered. A woman slowly walked down a hallway.</p><br/><p>The floor was covered in marble tiles, and the white walls had faint specks here and there. There was also a window where the leisurely sun beamed in. Within the normal, if not boring, hallway, only the woman seemed different.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is she? Did a woman like her live on our floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her since I\u2019ve moved here? Wow, she seems like a celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young couple acted like they had accidentally messed up their passcode to their door lock as they glanced at her.</p><br/><p>She wore a t-shirt, jeans, and black boots. While her clothes seemed normal, she herself was far from normal.</p><br/><p>She covered her eyes with large sunglasses and wore a baseball cap on her head. She covered her nose to her neck with the out-of-season scarf. Her hair shook under her scarf every step she took. She was a very suspicious yet interesting woman.</p><br/><p>When the couple failed their passcode for the third time, the woman stopped a few doors away from them. Her smooth hand stopped in front of the door lock before ringing the doorbell. Soon, the woman entered the apartment. The couple\u2019s gaze was fixed on the shut door.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat unit, it\u2019s the one with a lot of daughters, right? Is she one of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I did hear a bit from the lady since she liked to boast about her daughters a lot. The first one graduated from Hyemun Women\u2019s University and was preparing for a job. I think she said her second daughter was in the arts. Her fourth was in the varsity judo team. Something about becoming a national athlete or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the third?\u201d</p><br/><p>At her husband\u2019s question, she tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about the third. I think she said she was in the states?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha let out a stuffy breath. She took off her hat and sunglasses and undid her cumbersome scarf. She looked around the living room. There was a vase with sunflowers. The fabric sofa with cute little cushions was so old that its edges were frayed.</p><br/><p>Frames were hung on the wall. Lee Songha stared at the photos.</p><br/><p>At the top was a photo of the four sisters in a group hug when the youngest was only 100 days old. Below that were three daughters in school uniforms. Next to that was the first daughter\u2019s graduation photo, the second daughter receiving an award at a drawing contest, as well as a photo of the fourth daughter holding a medal from a regional tournament.</p><br/><p>Beside them hung a large photo of the family of five.</p><br/><p>The photo looked peaceful and natural. Lee Songha seemed different even here.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it hot outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged woman with a tidy short perm and gentle eye wrinkles asked. She was the stereotypical \u2018mother\u2019 image in a public service campaign. She was Lee Songha\u2019s mother. She had neatly sliced Korean melons in a tray. Lee Songha received the fork her mother handed her and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you take a family photo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that was to commemorate your older sister\u2019s graduation. I was going to tell you about it, but you\u2019re so busy. Also, if we have a photo of you in the living room, our guests are always going to make a fuss about it whenever they come over. It\u2019s not good for celebrities if their families show off like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen they start a business selling their child\u2019s name, use the money they earn and cause problems. Those people show up on the news every once in a while. I won\u2019t do something so uncultured and uneducated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mother patted Lee Songha\u2019s shoulder gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m acting like this all for you so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it. It looks good, the photo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha trailed off and turned her gaze. Her oldest sister opened her door and walked out while brushing her bed hair. Her face very much resembled her mother. She tapped her neck a couple of times with her fist before discovering Lee Songha and walking over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering if you arrived. What\u2019s the occasion? Is today some special day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Just. I got a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have time to take a break? You need to work hard while you\u2019re getting work. I saw an article that you earned 10 billion won? Celebrities really are nice. How many houses can you buy with that? I probably can\u2019t earn that even if I work my whole life in a big corporation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her oldest sister exclaimed while patting Lee Songha\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Her mother joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut celebrities have their peak. Songha, you\u2019re properly managing your money, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy company introduced me to an asset manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spend your money like water and save it. Celebrities are only celebrities when they have work. When they don\u2019t, they\u2019re jobless. You should listen to your sister and earn a lot while you can. I still think you should just focus on acting. I should talk with your CEO on\u2026 Let\u2019s talk about this later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mother stopped speaking after glancing at her oldest daughter.</p><br/><p>At some point, her oldest sister sat down on the sofa and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw Neptune\u2019s residential life on Making Film. You really are great at acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid it look like I was acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the staff give you lines? You talked twice as much as you do at home. You should talk more at home. Ah, also, you ate a ton over there too. You used to write your name on food at home too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, her mother chimed in,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, pig\u2019s feet, fried chicken, I was embarrassed when they continuously showed you eating that stuff. Your sisters don\u2019t do that, so why do you have such a big appetite? People will think that your parents starved you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the ones who starved. She received a lot to eat. Because she\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t like that when you were young. Maybe your eating habits worsened when you went to America alone? Anyways, eating only looks good if you do it moderation. It doesn\u2019t look good if you have too much of an appetite. It makes you look greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation came to a standstill when Lee Songha visibly frowned. Lee Songha placed her fork down on the plate. She hadn\u2019t eaten a single piece of melon. Just then, the front door opened with the sound of the door unlocking.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, hey, hey, wait! Stay out here for a bit. We have a guest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her youngest sister, who was in university, pushed her friends back out. Her friends, who also wore judo uniforms, were pushed out the door. She quickly closed the door and looked at Lee Songha with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou surprised me! You should have said you were coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I a guest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha asked. An awkward silence momentarily hung in the home. Lee Songha didn\u2019t wait for their answer and walked to the front door. She then put her boots on. Her youngest sister, whose eyes grew even wider, hastily grabbed Lee Songha\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Are you going out like that? My friends don\u2019t know you\u2019re my sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust continue telling them that I\u2019m your guest, not your sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha spoke in an even tone then grabbed the door handle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mother shouted as she approached her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister might become a national athlete. Do you think reporters will leave her alone when they find out she\u2019s your sister? How sorry do you think she\u2019ll be to her colleagues if articles show up saying that she\u2019s your sister and she receives the public\u2019s attention? It won\u2019t be good for you too. As I said, we are acting like this for yo-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it, so stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha cut her off. She then put on her sunglasses and hat and covered herself with the scarf. Her mother let out a sigh of relief. Having covered her face, Lee Songha opened the door. When the gazes of the waiting students fell on her, she raised her scarf up higher.</p><br/><p>She got on the elevator and pressed the button to the ground floor. The tips of her heavy boots tapped the floor. The people who got on from the lower floors were first surprised when they saw her and surprised again at her dark, gloomy mood.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha walked out as soon as the elevator doors opened. She slowed her steps once she was out of the apartment building like someone who didn\u2019t know where to go. She suddenly fumbled in her pocket and took out her phone. There were a few unread messages from Neptune\u2019s group chat.</p><br/><p>As expected, the first message was Im Seoyoung. She had gone back home, saying that she needed to spend her break with her family, and had uploaded a selfie. Behind Im Seoyoung, whose eyes were red, perhaps from crying, were her family members eating. They were having a feast.</p><br/><p>Below that were short replies from LJ and Lee Taehee. Lee Taehee had gone to a sushi place with her father and was day drinking, while LJ catching up with her old friends at a bar.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha put her fingers on the reply section before hesitating when her phone rang.</p><br/><p>Her slow steps completely stopped. She looked around before raising her sunglasses a little. She then checked the caller once more. Her dark eyes soon shined with a bright halo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>She placed her phone to her ear, and she walked cheerfully like she was tapdancing.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you waiting like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were a lot of people. I can\u2019t get discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Quickly getting in the passenger\u2019s seat, Lee Songha took off her disguise.</p><br/><p>Her face looked bright. My heart dropped, worried something might have happened. I came to pick her up after hearing she went to visit her family by herself, and she was waiting on a park bench while hugging her knees. Like some puppy waiting for her owner.</p><br/><p>I thought until inwardly clicking my tongue. Owner? Puppy?</p><br/><p>Damn it. To make that sort of comparison. I really was crazy.</p><br/><p>I looked to my side, and Lee Songha seemed to be in a good mood as she was humming a song. The way she opened the glove compartment and looked around was very natural. She opened a bag with large cookies. She offered one to me as she took a bite into another.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you hungry? Did you not eat at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We suddenly had a guest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go eat. I haven\u2019t eaten yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I had two bowls of rice at my brother\u2019s, but I could probably fit another bowl. I mean I skipped so many meals until now. I started to drive while thinking about a restaurant where we could eat in peace when Lee Songha packed her partly eaten cookie back in the bag.</p><br/><p>She then cautiously asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, does it look greedy when I eat a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, who the heck said that nonsense? You look good when you eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>So something did happen at home. I recalled Lee Songha\u2019s family, who I had seen from a distance. Her relationship with her family wasn\u2019t so bad that it would be article-worthy, but it wasn\u2019t affectionate either.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked down at the cookie as she spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot of sisters, both older and younger than me. I didn\u2019t have much to myself since I was young. Someone would always take it or it would disappear. That\u2019s why I like eating. It\u2019s mine once I swallow it. It\u2019s not like they can slice open my belly and take it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought this whenever I saw you. I hoped no one took you away, but because you\u2019re a human, I can\u2019t eat you. It made me nervous, so I think I became weird\u2026 You\u2019re not an object.\u201d</p><br/><p>She closed then opened her eyes and said with resolve,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to work hard until I\u2019m normal. Even if we\u2019re not working together every day, I think it\u2019ll be great if you came to pick me up and had a meal together occasionally. Also, once I become normal, like my plans\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her resolute voice trailed off, hiding the rest of her sentence.</p><br/><p>Until you become normal, you say?</p><br/><p>I fixed my gaze on the windshield and looked inwardly. The snake, which had been excitedly shedding its skin, stopped halfway. It looked at me as if asking why I was hesitating. To shed my skin completely.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Lee Songha who needed to work hard to become normal.</p><br/><p>Also\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, about your ten-year plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, did you say it was a five-year plan? The plan you mentioned.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she was taken aback by my question, Lee Songha stuttered as she replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt-it\u2019s a five-year plan. Since two years have passed, three years now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Three years, huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cThree years. Let\u2019s wait until then.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-183\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 183\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-185\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 185\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201481\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

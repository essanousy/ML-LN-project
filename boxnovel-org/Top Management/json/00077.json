Look at this. This. It\u2019s good to constantly moisturize your skin and provide it with nutrition during winter. Still, you don\u2019t have any blemishes. I\u2019ll add a light foundation. I think I just need to smooth out your skin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Please just end it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I sat in front of the dressing table, I had emptied my heart.</p><br/><p>The mustached artist affiliated with this shop smiled slyly. In his hand was a flat makeup brush. He dabbed the brush in a beige cream instead of paint and brushed it on my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung poked my shoulder from the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to call out to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung\u2019s face was reflected in the mirror in front of me. Her large, round eyes narrowed into crescent moons. She giggled in a way which didn\u2019t suit the smile from her eyes that seemed like it could even melt ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, oppa, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what, what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I already called out your name, I just wanted to say it three more times.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, she walked around me and looked as if I was some amazing spectacle. She reminded me of something. Her curly hair reminded me of fur and her shaking flared skirt reminded me of a tail.</p><br/><p>She seemed like a dog running in the snow, no, she was more like a puppy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that you\u2019ve been waiting for this day for a long time, but come to your senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, how do you feel sitting there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean how do I feel? I feel like I\u2019m receiving punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I would feel more at ease if they just scribbled on my face with permanent markers.</p><br/><p>I was extremely lucky that Kim Hyunjo and the traitor weren\u2019t here.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh, how can you consider this a punishment? I bet you\u2019d be foaming at the mouth if you were to receive full makeup! Do you want to try blush as well? They say this year\u2019s spring/summer color is light coral. This, this, my lipstick color!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop speaking such nonsense and just sit down. Why are you so excited? You\u2019re going to be exhausted before the recording if you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! My condition today is amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>She raised her fists as she shouted confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop driving me crazy and eat your lunch, dummy.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ approached and slapped Im Seoyoung\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Her blonde cascading hair and her makeup which curved her eyes in a sleek fashion made her look especially cat-like today. A street cat wearing the guise of an expensive breed.</p><br/><p>I thought that it would be nice to take a picture of the two of them right now.</p><br/><p>People from the fan caf\u00e9 had already made comparison photos about how they were like cats and dogs. This would make great bait.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought this, LJ shoved her phone towards me.</p><br/><p>Then she took my picture.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Why did you take a picture of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I think it might be useful in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t take pictures and don\u2019t use them either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hate it that much, it makes me want to take more. I\u2019ll use it for a good cause.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she smiled slightly. It was an eccentric smile.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung leaned towards LJ\u2019s phone and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMe, me, me. Send me those pictures you took!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it. You meanie! Fine, I\u2019ll just take pictures on my phone!\u201d</p><br/><p>She brought her phone over and took pictures of me. I sighed as I looked towards Lee Taehee and Lee Songha, hoping they were a bit better behaved.</p><br/><p>Hmm. They were as well-behaved as ever. They couldn\u2019t help but be well-behaved.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was sitting on the sofa and eating her lunch while Lee Taehee was sleeping on Lee Songha\u2019s lap.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen does today\u2019s recording air?\u201d</p><br/><p>The artist\u2019s assistant asked while smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLunar New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely watch it then. I think the program will be fun. I think it\u2019ll be fun if you just act like this in front of the camera without any MSG<sup>{1}</sup>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We see celebrities and managers all the time. There are many teams that give off such a bad mood that we can\u2019t even say a joke. But this team seems really close with each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that it looks that way on the broadcast as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Really.</p><br/><p>It was a public network broadcast and I candidly agreed to do it because Kim Hyunjo and Team Leader Park said I was the most suited for it, but I still wasn\u2019t sure if this would be good.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have the comedic senses that could make others burst into laughter on entertainment shows, and above all, I didn\u2019t really enjoy watching entertainment shows in general.</p><br/><p>Since I was going on the show anyway, I had to be of use to the girls.</p><br/><p>It seemed she saw my serious expression as Im Seoyoung patted my shoulder with the tips of her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, oppa! All you need to do is stick next to me! My talents<sup>{2{</sup> are perfect, and I picked out and practiced a ton of possible general knowledge quizzes! I even thoroughly memorized the capitals of countries!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe really spent all night memorizing them. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s trying to take a university entrance exam or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ said while clicking her tongue.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung swiftly turned and leered at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to be fully prepared so that we can show up on air often! Entertainment shows are like jungles, jungles! If you go without any preparations, you could be disregarded by other people on the show and even be edited out entirely!\u201d</p><br/><p>After scolding in a rapid-fire fashion, her eyes shined as she added,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how big of an opportunity this is? I\u2019ll show them everything I have out there!\u201d</p><br/><p>The title of the special was \u2018Star Manager\u2019.</p><br/><p>The concept looked simple. The compatibility between celebrities and their managers.</p><br/><p>It was a mix between a talk show and a variety show<sup>{3}</sup>, where they gathered a bunch of celebrities and their managers, talked and played a few games before finally giving a prize to the team that was picked as being the most compatible.</p><br/><p>The prize was a high-quality beef set.</p><br/><p>It seemed Lee Songha\u2019s drive surged as her eyes shined brightly.</p><br/><p>Well, the talk show was simply an attempt in bringing out fun stories from managers who knew the most about their celebrities\u2019 personal lives.</p><br/><p>This seemed somewhat fine, but the games were the problem.</p><br/><p>The game was called \u2018Stop telling me to do this and that and you do it\u2019.</p><br/><p>They said it was a \u2018walking in someone\u2019s shoes\u2019 type of game where the positions of managers and celebrities were switched. The broadcast composition was so simple that no matter how many times I read over it, I couldn\u2019t tell what we were specifically going to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you look the part. You really do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, who arrived late, said as he glanced at me.</p><br/><p>But why was he by himself?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gunyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI assigned him some other work and came by myself. How are the girls? They\u2019ll probably be nervous since it\u2019s their first time appearing on an entire entertainment special on a public network, with all four of them to boot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the most nervous out of all the people appearing on the show today.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Kim Hyunjo grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really show even if you are nervous. Your impression and mood will give you a boost. You just need to act naturally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I took the girls around to their schedules without Kim Hyunjo these days, maybe it was because I was a part of the cast and not a manager this time, but having Kim Hyunjo here was reassuring.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Also, don\u2019t forget to talk about Lee Songha\u2019s incident during the talk show segment. Since that part is undoubtedly going on air, prepare what you\u2019re going to say ahead of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I will. But chief,\u201d</p><br/><p>I licked my dry lips and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really okay to mention him on air?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that came from the higher ups. Even the CEO personally okayed it. Before this airs, the company will also put out a news release.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo firmly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t need to worry about the aftermath and just talk. That man needs to be screwed over. Although it\u2019s a pity we can\u2019t straight up say his name, even this is disgracing that man\u2019s arrogant face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo smiled creepily.</p><br/><p>As if infected by it, my lips raised into a creepy smile as well.</p><br/><p>I thought that I had become used to seeing celebrities after working as a manager for a few months now, but today felt different.</p><br/><p>If the majority of celebrities I had seen until now were actors and singers, there were many comedians and TV personalities here today.</p><br/><p>While going around the dressing rooms and greeting them, I felt exhausted.</p><br/><p>Rather than calling it a greeting, it was more of an investigation. Although Next K-Star was an entertainment show as well, this place was on a completely different level from it. I could understand why Im Seoyoung said that entertainment programs were a jungle.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the girls, wearing their sponsored clothes, came to me.</p><br/><p>But one person was missing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Seoyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if frustrated, LJ clicked her tongue and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the waiting room. She said she\u2019ll come after practicing her talents one last time before the recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s practicing again?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Lee Songha replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came out ahead of her since she said she couldn\u2019t concentrate with us there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to go to the waiting room when Lee Taehee held me back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems she\u2019s overwhelmed by pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPressure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes, which were as calm as lakes, shined with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack when we were completely unknown, Seoyoung went on several entertainment programs to spread our name. Maybe it\u2019s because of that, but it seems she thinks everything rests on her shoulders. She looks like she\u2019s feeling a lot of pressure, but she won\u2019t talk to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ and Lee Songha both added in,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was making an abnormally big deal out of everything at the shop today. She keeps going back and forth like a puppy that has to go. Her condition must be crap since she stayed up all night so it\u2019s concerning she says her condition\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, she didn\u2019t eat much this morning. She didn\u2019t even touch her lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, okay. Go in first and let the chief know.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving the girls behind, I quickly headed to the waiting room.</p><br/><p>I should have observed her more carefully.</p><br/><p>Although I did think that she was more agitated than normal, I thought it was because she really wanted to appear on entertainment shows. Was she suffering from pressure while showing a cheerfully smiling face?</p><br/><p>I immediately opened the door and entered the waiting room.</p><br/><p>No, I stopped before I went in. Im Seoyoung stood rigidly right behind the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, oppa! I was just about to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung tilted her head. Her voice was as bright as usual. However, it was definitely different. It was the same for her slightly reddened eyes and her trembling pupils.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you very nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I asked, Im Seoyoung shook her head in a wide motion.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo? I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really am. Let\u2019s go quickly, oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, unlike her words, Im Seoyoung couldn\u2019t take a single step passed the door. Her round shoes moved hesitantly before returning to its place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, damn it. Why am I like this\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>She squatted on the floor and covered her head with her arms.</p><br/><p>I heard sniffling coming from her mumbling voice. I went inside and closed the door. Im Seoyoung, who had lowered her head, raised it slightly. Sure enough, tears had welled up in her large eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t cry. The mascara might run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really, is it time to worry about that right now? You still have time to fix your makeup so it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said in the lightest tone I could in order to make her relax a little, but it seemed it didn\u2019t help. I was flustered and didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>I sat in front of Im Seoyoung and met her gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have told me if you were this nervous. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re committing a sin or anything, why are you trembling in nervousness by yourself in the waiting room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was definitely fine. I really was. But,\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung bit her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a really big opportunity. It\u2019s on a public network, and it\u2019s a Lunar New Year\u2019s special. We\u2019ll appear in it for the full hour. I always thought that it would be great if we could get an opportunity like this and that I would really do well if we got the opportunity. That\u2019s why I practiced every day\u2026 But I suddenly became scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We got this opportunity, but what if I suck?\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought her voice was shaking, and in the end, a tear fell from her tightly closed eyes.</p><br/><p>The dam that had endured for this long finally broke and it was instantaneous afterwards. A second and third tear dripped.</p><br/><p>\u201cEuaah, I\u2019m crying. What do I do?! I need something to wipe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Worried her tear would flow down her cheek and ruin her makeup; she positioned her face towards the floor and flailed her arms.</p><br/><p>I pulled out a few tissues from the tissue box in the waiting room and handed them to her. Im Seoyoung received them and carefully patted her tears.</p><br/><p>I kept pulling out tissues as I thought about how I could calm her down.</p><br/><p>I first patted her shoulders. When I did, she quickly shrunk away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you can\u2019t. If you do that, I\u2019ll cry more! Tears are dripping just by hearing your voice!\u201d</p><br/><p>With no other choice, I pulled my hand away and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWill the world collapse if you mess up a little this time? You just need to do better next time. Your next album will be released soon and you\u2019ll have many opportunities to appear on entertainment shows in the future. I\u2019ll work to the bone and keep getting you shows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to do well this time too. I went on entertainment shows the most. Hyunjo oppa, Taehee unni, LJ, and Songha. They\u2019ll all be thinking that I\u2019ll do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a stupid dummy\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung slammed her head against the door.</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> So in this case, the assistant is saying that they just need to act natural and don\u2019t need to try to be fun and entertaining.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> Explained previously, but basically, \u2018impersonations\u2019, \u2018imitations\u2019, \u2018singing\u2019. \u2018jokes\u2019, etc.</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> A very popular entertainment format in Korea.

The difference between Sung Dowon and us is too large!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung pounded her chest in frustration.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee showed a rare serious face and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about us and think about it again. It\u2019s a really big opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to be assigned to an actor originally? Then there\u2019s no need to think. Of course, you need to say you are going to be Sung Dowon\u2019s manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even LJ, who usually joked around, seriously seconded her words.</p><br/><p>Even Lee Songha, who hadn\u2019t spoken yet, stared at me to the point my face started burning.</p><br/><p>Staying amidst them, my complicated mind started to fade.</p><br/><p>Even if I didn\u2019t see the future, and I chose Neptune over Sung Dowon based fully on my own decision\u2026 I might not have regretted this decision.</p><br/><p>I smiled as I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided after thinking about my life. I didn\u2019t get a good vibe when I thought about being Sung Dowon\u2019s manager. And I think you girls will become bigger successes than Sung Dowon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reaction to my sincerity was short.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, there\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You can\u2019t change your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe opportunity has passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung was the first to flop onto the floor. The other girls and Kim Hyun sat on the ground as well. I continued to hear them say that I threw away my good fortune and came back or that I was a weird person for a while longer.</p><br/><p>Then, after the situation calmed a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to practice harder from now on\u2026 I\u2019ll really do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others nodded at Im Seoyoung\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The girls got up saying they would practice some more, and I told Kim Hyunjo everything I knew about Lee Songha and the acting teacher. I carefully mentioned Son Chaeyoung as well. When the girls joined in with me, Kim Hyunjo showed a serious expression and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Younghoon hyung and I will look into this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He dusted off his seat and sighed when he looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should go home today and rest, eat something good for breakfast too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay, when would I go to work tomorrow?</p><br/><p>\u201cEat lunch and come to work by 3.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked again because I couldn\u2019t believe my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Since you did something big on your break. I\u2019ll look at your schedule this week and give you another day off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo left while waving his hand.</p><br/><p>After saying goodbye and turning around happily, I became startled. Lee Songha was standing right in front of me.</p><br/><p>Ah right, I did have something to say to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha suddenly bowed her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor paying attention to me. I am sorry for saying this so late. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when I was about to answer.</p><br/><p>Huh? This was the second time today.</p><br/><p>My vision changed, and I saw my future twenty years from now.</p><br/><p>With no time to wonder, I heard Reporter Song\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a question that I thought of after you said you don\u2019t know how someone is going to end up, but who is the first person who comes to your mind when you think \u2018I never thought that person would be this successful\u2019 back when you were a new recruit?\u201d</p><br/><p>I perked my ears because this was a question I was really curious about.</p><br/><p>But while my future self was thinking about the question, Director Park suddenly cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it Lee Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would have thought Lee Songha would suddenly succeed in acting, especially in Hollywood, back when Neptune was only singing and dancing? No matter how many people say you never know which cloud it will rain from in the entertainment world, for Lee Songha, it was more like it started raining in a cloudless sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was it.</p><br/><p>A nail.</p><br/><p>A certainty that my thoughts weren\u2019t wrong was nailed into my head.</p><br/><p>My future self bitterly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the part I\u2019m most regretful of. Songha started acting long after I quit being Neptune\u2019s manager. If I knew that she was talented in acting when she was young, maybe she would be a much more amazing actress now\u2026 I always regretted this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since Lee Songha did start acting in her thirties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s no use saying it now, but to be honest, I thought this when I first saw her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 I could tell what my future self was about to say next.</p><br/><p>Since I thought the same thing when I first saw her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat she should be an actress instead of a singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was standing next to me again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to sound calm as I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo me, it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a problem with you, but a problem with the acting teacher, who taught you. I\u2019ll try to confirm it properly so if you don\u2019t hate acting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out the Cat Guardian Ghost synopsis I always carried in my bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you like to read this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha reached out with a smiling face.</p><br/><p>When I woke up the next morning, I felt a stiff happiness in my chest.</p><br/><p>Light shone through the small window in my one-room apartment and tickled my face. My pillow felt soft, and my blanket felt smooth; a smile crept up my face.</p><br/><p>I felt it was worth paying my month rent for a change.</p><br/><p>I stretched and got up. When I looked at the time, it was 1 p.m. Since I slept after 2 a.m. yesterday, I slept a ton. How long had it been? Maybe it was because I hadn\u2019t slept properly in a while, but my head that had been muddled from sleep deprivation cleared and my body felt lighter.</p><br/><p>Yes. This was it. This was how a person should live.</p><br/><p>An employee who leisurely eats brunch before going to work. It felt good.</p><br/><p>I looked at the dusty rice cooker and thought momentarily. It was a pain to cook rice. But I didn\u2019t have enough time to order delivery.</p><br/><p>Eventually, I microwaved some instant rice and set up my meal with the side dishes my sister-in-law brought me. The meal I set up for the first time in a while seemed a little boring so I chopped a few green onions and made steamed eggs. It was a sumptuous feast.</p><br/><p>I ate with my spoon and chopsticks as I opened my laptop and began my daily routine.</p><br/><p>The first thing I did was search Neptune and checked if there were any new articles about them. Well, there wasn\u2019t much today. Only one line in a news article about Next K-Star?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t only check entertainment news but also large community sites many people participated in.</p><br/><p>Luckily, there weren\u2019t any negative comments.</p><br/><p>There should some reaction after the first broadcast.</p><br/><p>Next, I checked the lineup for winter dramas.</p><br/><p>I may be getting ahead of myself, but I kept collecting information ever since the day I received the Cat Guardian Ghost synopsis, mainly on projects that would compete against it once Lee Songha got the part.</p><br/><p>Time Slip and Mermaid out of Water were picked as the most promising projects out of the three public TV networks, and there were a few projects that caught my eye from cable and comprehensive programming channels<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><br/><p>I was glancing through new articles, and a few headlines in the entertainment section caught my attention.</p><br/><p>[\u2018Mermaid out of Water\u2019 Powerful Lineup, Son Chaeyoung confirmed] [Super Extravagant Casting! \u2018Mermaid out of Water\u2019 released in January with Son Chaeyoung] [Will the promising project, \u2018Mermaid out of Water\u2019, revive the stagnated public TV miniseries?]\u00a0</p><br/><p>Ah, so she ended up choosing this one.</p><br/><p>The article continued to by stating Son Chaeyoung decided to go with \u2018Mermaid out of Water\u2019 as her next project, that there were higher expectations and interest due to the popularity of the original and their extravagant casting, and that it was a promising project that might save the continuous line of disastrous rating of public TV miniseries.</p><br/><p>Well, the results of public TV miniseries these days were depressing.</p><br/><p>There were no projects that surpassed a 20% viewership rating in the summer, and it had come to the point where a consistent 12-13% rating was considered a success.</p><br/><p>The stakeholders were all probably hoping for a successful project to come out and break this streak.</p><br/><p>Though, this mermaid drama would go under after hitting a 3% viewership rating.</p><br/><p>Not long ago, I would have been regretted Son Chaeyoung jumping into the sea, but now I was surprised by how much it didn\u2019t concern me. The fact she told me to screw off was secondary, it was more because I felt uncomfortable by my suspicion that she may have played a part against Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t see it through my foresight, it didn\u2019t feel good. If it was later revealed this wasn\u2019t only a suspicion, then even cursing her to fail wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and opened the comment section. The reactions were explosive due to the popularity of the original. It hadn\u2019t been long since it was published, but there were already hundreds of comments.</p><br/><p>-Whoa, amazing. Son Chaeyoung? January come quickly *shivers*</p><br/><p>-Euaheuah so good T^T I believe in Son Chaeyoung\u2019s Rocco!</p><br/><p>-Is it only me who feels a bit regretful about the matching?</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s just you. Son Chaeyoung is an amazing choice, don\u2019t pour cold water over it.</p><br/><p>-Though there is a bit of a mismatch between their images, I believe Son Chaeyoung\u2019s acting abilities will be able to cover it.</p><br/><p>-It will be a success as long as they follow the original well.</p><br/><p>For now, their reactions were positive and favorable.</p><br/><p>I read other articles before searching Cat Guardian Ghost. There were only a few articles about how strong candidates for the main roles were reviewing it positively before, eventually, turning it down. Compared to the mermaid drama, there were far fewer articles, and comments were hard to find. It definitely lacked in newsworthiness.</p><br/><p>I was looking at them seriously when my phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, mom?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yeah. Can you talk?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, it had been a while since I called my mom.</p><br/><p>-I packed and sent some side dishes and green onion kimchi. It\u2019ll arrive tomorrow so put them in the fridge when you get home from work. You can\u2019t leave them out for too long.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, you should have let dad eat them. Sister-in-law already sends me side dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Even if we eat it at home, we don\u2019t eat much. I made ginger tea by preserving it in honey so put some in hot water and drink it. So you don\u2019t catch a cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do that. And you and father aren\u2019t sick or anything, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>-We\u2019re fine. How\u2019s work? I asked someone whose son works at a broadcasting company, and they said that celebrity managers have it hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. Even yesterday\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled something while thinking of something to say to set her at ease.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have the time to think about it because yesterday was so eventful, but didn\u2019t CEO Baek Hansung tell me to pick out a car? And the director brought up the Rolls Royce afterwards\u2026 No, let\u2019s forget about that.</p><br/><p>Still, me refusing Sung Dowon\u2019s offer had nothing to do with it, right? Probably?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mom, I think I\u2019m going to get a car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I couldn\u2019t believe it myself.</p><br/><p>-Isn\u2019t it better to lease a place to live once you have the money? And buy a car later.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not buying it with my own money. The CEO of my company said he\u2019d buy one.\u201d</p><br/><p>-What?!</p><br/><p>Well, this was no surprise since I wasn\u2019t sure even though I heard it personally.</p><br/><p>Her voice was filled with worry and distrust.</p><br/><p>-The company you work for, Double Ent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW&amp;U\u201d</p><br/><p>-Is it a proper company? It\u2019s not a place with strange scammers, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a proper company. Mom, it\u2019s quite a big company in this industry. I resolved an incredibly important problem so he said he would buy me one. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not a fool, I wouldn\u2019t accept if something was odd.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to explain the best I could, but my mom didn\u2019t seem to buy it at all. There was a 100% chance she would call my brother and sister-in-law for more details. My brother would probably call me later as well.</p><br/><p>I hung up after hearing repeatedly that the world was full of bad people and that I should always be suspicious. By the time I finished my food that had turned cold, it was almost 2.</p><br/><p>Now that I had become accustomed to it, I got ready in an instant and left my one-room apartment.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because it was a weekday afternoon, but the subway was quiet. I bought some limited edition snacks from the muffin shop in the subway station. I bought some because I was going to work late.</p><br/><p>While waiting for the subway, I went on the group chat that I hadn\u2019t been on for a long time. Maybe it really had been a long time because messages popped up one after another.</p><br/><p>They were from my friends I went to high school with who made me wonder if they were really my friends or enemies sometimes.</p><br/><p>They were guys I met and hung out with constantly, but because I never went out after getting a job, they were all asking me if I was alive or not.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m not dead. Just think I re-entered military service and forget about me for a while.</p><br/><p>As soon as I sent the message, there were a bunch of replies.</p><br/><p>It seemed like these guys were chatting instead of doing their work.</p><br/><p>-Military? What? It\u2019s that hard?</p><br/><p>-To be honest, you need to buy us food the day you get your first paycheck. I bought beef. I remember exactly how much damn beef you ate that day.</p><br/><p>-Hey, don\u2019t you meet a lot of celebrities as a manager? Get me a date.</p><br/><p>-Me too.</p><br/><p>-Me too.</p><br/><p>These crazy guys.</p><br/><p>I told them to eat well and to stop spouting nonsense.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long to arrive at work. A big storm passed by yesterday, but things were running today like any other day. When I got off on the fourth floor, a familiar chief-level employee greeted me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuck Thrower<sup>[2]</sup>, you came?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Hello\u2026 Pardon?\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>[1]</sup> Channels that offer all genres of contents. Requires a subscription to cable or satellite.</p><br/><p><sup>[2]</sup> So this was the reason why I used Bokdongee instead of Lucky Charm previously. The employee called him Bokdangee, which roughly translates to Luck Tosser/Trasher/Kicker. Let me know what you guys prefer: Bokdongee/Bokdangee or Lucky Charm/Luck Tosser. Edit: I think I might go with Luck Thrower..</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-32\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 32\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-34\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 34\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201178\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

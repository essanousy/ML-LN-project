Joo Jaechan. So they knew each other.</p><br/><p>-City Jungle isn\u2019t a very common title, and I had only come up with it recently after thinking about it for the past few months. I also heard you mentioned the noir genre, which is what my project is. It all fit perfectly, so I was just wondering\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>The pieces all fit together, but the final picture was very odd.</p><br/><p>-If I was mistaken then I\u2019m really sorry. Please excus-!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said calmly so that I wouldn\u2019t have too high hopes or be too disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe talked while having a few drinks so my memory is hazy. The project came up while we were discussing minor genres. Hmm, I didn\u2019t know that it was your work.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Pardon?</p><br/><p>Her excited breaths suddenly stiffened.</p><br/><p>-\u2026 Did Director Joo Jaechan say it was his?</p><br/><p>She reacted in a sensitive manner, like her precious egg was being threatened.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for my reply, Director Oh Hyunkyung hastily said.</p><br/><p>-Then you\u2019ve been tricked. City Jungle. Maybe not in the past, but now it\u2019s my work.</p><br/><p>Now?</p><br/><p>-I bought it.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I twirled my phone in my hand before tossing it aside. Thunder rumbled outside.</p><br/><p>I dragged the IV stand over and opened the window. A fresh breeze and raindrops blew in, accompanied by the pitter-patter of rain. It was refreshing. I looked up at the sky, which seemed to want to wash the earth away, before sticking my head out the window.</p><br/><p>She bought the scenario.</p><br/><p>If Director Joo Jaechan sold her his scenario and gave up all rights to the work, then there would be no problems with the law. Director Joo Jaechan would not be able to claim his right on the work either.</p><br/><p>However, why was it back in Director Joo Jaechan\u2019s possession in the future?</p><br/><p>Did Director Joo Jaechan buy it back?</p><br/><p>Or\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? That\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone grabbed the back of my neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll die if you fall from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking back, I saw a face covered with a black face mask. It was Seo Jijoon. While he pulled me away from the window from the back of my neck, Chief Lee Bongjoon closed the window. Just what outrageous thoughts were they thinking right now?</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just taking in the breeze. Why would I fall?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Seo Jijoon tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOut of impulse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked laughing, but there was no reply. Rather, Seo Jijoon\u2019s eyes turned slightly misty.</p><br/><p>I told him the exact same words I told Im Joowon as I sat back down on my bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cthere was no need for you to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came because it was a rare opportunity for me to go out. I wanted to feel the breeze too.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took off his mask and handed me a basket.</p><br/><p>It was a basket of roses. I wasn\u2019t even surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bigger than last time. And redder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI paid special attention because it was a hospital visit. Ah, apparently, they don\u2019t gift flowers for hospital visits these days. It wasn\u2019t good for the patient. Allergies and such.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you know that, then why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are soap flowers. You can pick one out and use it when you\u2019re taking a bubble bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll use it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>I placed the flowers on top of the cabinet shelf. Chief Lee Bongjoon clicked his tongue as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how shocked I was when I heard that you fainted after going to get water and had to be brought out by an ambulance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably less than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were suffering mentally, you should have let us know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I did have various symptoms for mental illnesses, I didn\u2019t have a panic disorder.</p><br/><p>However, Chief Lee Bongjoon and Seo Jijoon didn\u2019t look like they believed me. I had initially thought that those rumors were spread by those who didn\u2019t like me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it really look like there\u2019s something wrong with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon rubbed the bridge of his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look fine on the outside. If I were you, I would probably have a panic disorder, loss of appetite, and a mental breakdown? But you looked extremely normal even who the situation changed drastically after the Team 2 Leader left. I would have continued to think that if you didn\u2019t faint.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was simply exhaustion and sleep deprivation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018simply\u2019. Whether it\u2019s exhaustion or sleep deprivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Chief Lee Bongjoon patted my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt could be that you\u2019ve been accumulating a lot of burden without you realizing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon said while scratching his neck,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I said I wanted to work with you, it wasn\u2019t because I had hopes that all my projects would be successes if I did. I\u2019m not smart, but I\u2019m not that senseless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon smirked. Seo Jijoon added,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I did think you\u2019d have a better eye for projects than Bongjoon hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to tell you that you don\u2019t need to worry about it in case you felt burdened because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Jijoon looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to retire after one or two projects. It\u2019s normal for there to be bad times and good times. I\u2019ll do what I can and leave the rest to the heavens. Also, above all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His sharp eyes curved in a joking manner,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why I wanted to work with you is simply because I thought it would be fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>So many people came to visit me even though I was only there for a day.</p><br/><p>After Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon left, Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup came to visit. Even Im Joowon visited after finishing his entertainment show schedule. Pretty Girls and Chief Lee Taeshin visited at night after coming all the way from Busan.</p><br/><p>The rain calmed in the morning, and I looked back on the past few days.</p><br/><p>Although everything happened before I could even catch my breath. My relationship with the Team 2 Leader sharply deteriorated, and because he left the company, I was able to bring in people into my team faster and without any big obstacles.</p><br/><p>Did I have no free time?</p><br/><p>It seemed like it. Receiving the duties of a team leader, the number of meetings and discussions increased. There was a lot more I had to organize. On top of all that, I was absorbed in thinking about my actor\u2019s next projects and my future visions that there were a few days where I didn\u2019t sleep a wink.</p><br/><p>Burden.</p><br/><p>I recalled Seo Jijoon\u2019s words. Kim Hyunjo had said it before too. That if I failed once, I could just succeed the next time. That my life wasn\u2019t over because I failed. I had thought that I had put down some pressure to succeed after that.</p><br/><p>The uncertain future visions kept tugging at my mind.</p><br/><p>Just in case I saw a vision where the project I chose failed.</p><br/><p>In case I saw a vision where the project I rejected became a hit.</p><br/><p>In case I would regret my decision like this time.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ok-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, you have a guest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fin\u2026 A guest?\u201d</p><br/><p>An employee nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said her name was Director Oh Hyunkyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung?</p><br/><p>I thought I ended yesterday\u2019s call quite well, but why did she suddenly show up here?</p><br/><p>When I frowned, the employee looked taken aback and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought her to a meeting room because she said she brought a movie scenario. I had thought that you had set up a meeting with her since she mentioned that she had talked to you on the phone yesterday. Was that not the case?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe brought a scenario?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I say you have another meeting and send her back? Ah, but because the director came to see you, Chief Park and Chief Yoon went over to greet her.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were the chiefs under Team 2. They were the prime suspects for spreading rumors about my panic disorder. They probably went over because they were interested than to greet her. In case it was a scenario I was interested in.</p><br/><p>This was complicated.</p><br/><p>The events where Director Oh Hyunkyung came to see me and where she meets other chiefs were probably not in the original future. I had planned on walking the path and waiting for the project to come into my hands, but hiccups have already begun to appear.</p><br/><p>If things were headed in a direction I couldn\u2019t predict\u2026</p><br/><p>I made my decision and asked the employee,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>The meeting room was full. I saw Chief Park and Chief Yoon\u2019s bitter faces through the window. Chief Lee Bongjoon sat his round body right between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon got up when he saw me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be on our way. Please enjoy your meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other chiefs reluctantly got up with even more bitter expressions under Chief Lee Bongjoon\u2019s prodding. Chief Park\u2019s gaze landed on the scenario on top of the table for a moment, but he left without much regret. After sending those two off first, Chief Lee Bongjoon whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems she\u2019s here to promote her scenario. Why there are investors who pay attention if it\u2019s a scenario you\u2019re interested in. There are a lot of people who come to meet you with those motives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see what kind of project it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard from her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked back at the meeting room as he clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stylish action noir. I\u2019ll have to read the scenario to know for sure, but from what I heard, it seems like it\u2019ll cost a lot to produce. A director who had numerous flops in the past and a small-scale production company. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll receive enough investments. I wonder if it\u2019ll even be produced.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sent Chief Lee Bongjoon off and entered the meeting room.</p><br/><p>The woman, who had been standing for a while now, was looking at me with a nervous smile. Her hands were tightly clutching her scenario. My gaze focused on the title page for a moment. Below the title \u2018City Jungle\u2019 was a clearly printed name.</p><br/><p>Script/Director: Oh Hyunkyung</p><br/><p>This would be produced and become a huge success.</p><br/><p>If the owner changes.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-198\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 198\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-200\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 200\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201509\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

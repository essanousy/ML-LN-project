The drumming rain and shouts of reporters that drowned my ears grew distant. I was sitting in the meeting room once again. This was the present. The present. Okay, so what I saw was the future. Just as I took a step back from this horrible word\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung? What should we do about Ms. Jung Jae?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Yoo Sooyoung asked.</p><br/><p>A chill ran down my spine. My blood seemed to gush out from me like a hunted animal that was hung upside down. I clenched my tingly hands a couple of times. The reporter\u2019s voice rang in my ears.</p><br/><p>Suicide. To commit suicide. What in\u2026!</p><br/><p>No, let\u2019s calm down. This hasn\u2019t happened yet. Yeah, not yet.</p><br/><p>Damn it. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was very far off either.</p><br/><p>I rubbed my face beaded with cold sweat and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we need to be more proactively looking for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore proactively?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone stared at me at my unexpected statement. Even Chief Lee Taeshin.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really a need to? If this fails, then we\u2019ll be tight for time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI felt things were a bit serious when I last talked to her. It also makes me uneasy that no one can get in contact her still. I\u2019m worried she might be having some dark thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy dark thoughts you mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone held their breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough I hope I\u2019m just being excessively worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. You scared me there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, we aren\u2019t tight for time yet, so let\u2019s keep looking for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I concluded and stood up. Chief Lee Taeshin\u2019s gaze followed me.</p><br/><p>I hid my urgency and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lee, do you have a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>I led, almost dragged, Chief Lee Taeshin to the outdoor smoking area.</p><br/><p>A clear, cloudless sky was revealed when I opened the door. A lazy spring breeze shook the grass. This was definitely the present, yet it still felt surreal. My vision was still filled with afterimages of camera flashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, Chief Jung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin examined my complexion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for giving us some breathing room. But, Jae won\u2019t have such dark thoughts you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure? When we can\u2019t even get in contact with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worked almost ten years since elementary school to be a singer. She experienced a ton of hardships but overcame all of them. She\u2019s an only child so she deeply cares about her parents as well. There\u2019s no way she\u2019d do anything like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like hell there isn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Still, it seemed he found my words a bit concerning as he tried to call her again. It looked like she still wasn\u2019t picking up. Seeing this, my chaotic mess of a mind slowly seemed to regain its calm.</p><br/><p>I held onto the rail and took deep breaths.</p><br/><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to space out. I needed to get it together and think through this.</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora, who left for NK Entertainment, would make a media play involving Pretty Girls. In that process, they would bring up how a member was called to drinking parties. Once it\u2019s revealed that it was Jung Jae, dirty, stinging gazes would fixate on her.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 suicide.</p><br/><p>Suspicions that a member of topical girl group might have been involved in sexual favors. Her image would be dragged through the mud, and even if she denied them at the top of her lungs, those rumors would follow her like a shadow.</p><br/><p>Even if she was a steadfast girl who wouldn\u2019t crumble over easily as Chief Lee Taeshin said, she might have such an impulse in that sort of situation. She was only 22, and she spent half her life with the goal of becoming a celebrity.</p><br/><p>On top of that, there was a high chance she would be mentally unstable.</p><br/><p>Damn it. I felt sick thinking about suicide again.</p><br/><p>My gaze unconsciously looked below the banister. The ground was far away.</p><br/><p>I swept away the thoughts that spread like mold in my mind. Let\u2019s take action first. Let\u2019s find out where Jung Jae is and what she\u2019s doing and stop Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora before they do anything crazy.</p><br/><p>I asked Chief Lee Taeshin, who was calling to no avail,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have no idea where she might be? Someone among her family or friends who might be hiding her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least not her parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cChecking the phone number she called her parents with, it was a public number in Seoul. Near Yeoungdeungpo. I think she\u2019s still in Seoul, but none of the past trainees or members who left Pretty Girls had an idea where she might be. It\u2019s no time to be like this. I\u2019ll go and look for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPark Hyojin and Yoon Bora.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought about it, and those two know too much. They know that their previous president took a member to drinking parties, and it could become a problem if this gets out. I think we need to make sure they don\u2019t leak anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Chief Lee Taeshin opened and closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since we would have to take stronger measure if it wasn\u2019t settled politely.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think he could ever do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead, tell me more about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy that you mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInformation that I can use to lock their lips in the worst-case scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even know what to say and not to say and were capable of stabbing their previous members in the back for their own success. Once they knew that there was a knife aimed at them, they would be scared and be cautious.</p><br/><p>The sharper and clearer the knife, the more effective it would be.</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin paled when he saw my expression. He clung onto me as though he thought I was going to go over there, grab them by their collars, and threaten them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCh-Chief Jung, it\u2019s understandable that you are worried since the mood wasn\u2019t great when they left. But they were just too emotional at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that they caused trouble for you once the articles were released.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026 How could they not act after seeing such articles? They narrowly missed the opportunity they had waited for the past two years for. Even if I were them, I would need someone to resent as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>His desperate attempts at trying to change my mind were almost pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was almost for a moment. They are fine now. They decided to wholeheartedly support us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd about the dri-drinking parties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin bit his lips before continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all know that they shouldn\u2019t tell others about that. They are so bad to harass members who they spent years with. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two you are protecting would flap their mouths in an interview soon.</p><br/><p>And the Jung Jae you trust would never have bad thoughts would die.</p><br/><p>A thought suddenly crossed my mind. In the future where Jung Jae dies and after knowing that those two were responsible for that situation, how would this person cope? Would he still be able to live like a normal person?</p><br/><p>My thoughts of threatening him into cooperation smoldered.</p><br/><p>I let out a short sigh before saying in a calm voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think I would just threaten them? I\u2019m only preparing for the worst-case scenario. If I don\u2019t tell them the seriousness of it, they might accidentally leak it to the press, and even if they didn\u2019t want to, NK Entertainment might push them to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few more exchanges, Chief Lee Taeshin nodded while looking like someone who was about to squeal on his family.</p><br/><p>He spoke.</p><br/><p>I left Lee Kwanwoo to organize the schedule and left the company.</p><br/><p>I made a necessary stop and made a few calls before finally picking up my phone.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>They were wearing a racy corset-style top that exposed their cleavage, a garter belt that went past their short skirt and down their thighs. NK Entertainment\u2019s soon-to-debut girl group got in position in those outfits. The camera stubbornly focused on their cleavage and legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cPark Hyojin, Yoon Bora! Why do you keep flinching? Are you not confident in your bodies?\u201d</p><br/><p>The NK chief clicked his tongue as he observed the shoot.</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora fiddled with her hair as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just our first time doing a photoshoot wearing something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they keep up when they\u2019ve already debuted before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chuckles could be heard from the other members. Yoon Bora frowned.</p><br/><p>As soon as the shoot was over, Yoon Bora and Park Hyojin rushed to the dressing room. Yoon Bora threw off her outfit, which was no different from lingerie.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me our stage outfits will be like this? How can we go on TV while wearing something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe stage outfits must be different. They need to consider the broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed the other members heard them when they entered the room as they said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you never done a sexy concept when you were in Pretty Girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever. Half of the group were minors. They are the only ones left, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it Making Film? I heard they started filming, have they approached you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you should ask the-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it. It\u2019s not like this is your first time bringing this up. I\u2019m tired of hearing about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin quietly shot them a glance. The other members, who had been laughing, stiffened. The mood in the dressing room tensed. Just before Yoon Bora and Park Hyojin were about to leave after taking their things, they heard whispers behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t wear things like this, why did they join a group with a sexy concept?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, right? They were so proud of their stage experience. Look at them now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin held Yoon Bora back when she turned around, face red. Studio staff and NK Entertainment employees were busily cleaning up the shoot. Park Hyojin gestured at them as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see there are a lot of people? Don\u2019t cause a fuss. We need to maintain our image.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still frustrating! They\u2019re always whispering behind our backs when they will benefit once our popularity rises after talking to the press. I dare them to try to take advantage of us then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Panting, Yoon Bora angrily picked up her phone. It was vibrating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, I\u2019m sorry for calling you all of a sudden. I received this number from Chief Lee Taeshin.</p><br/><p>It was a deep, gentle voice. Yoon Bora tilted her head.</p><br/><p>-My name is Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Jung Sunwoo, chief or temporary team leader at W&amp;U. Whatever the position, I am Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora\u2019s eyes bulged. She hastily tapped Park Hyojin\u2019s shoulder. When Park Hyojin turned around, Yoon Bora silently mouthed, \u2018Jung Sunwoo\u2019. Soon, Park Hyojin\u2019s eyes widened too.</p><br/><p>As soon as she hung up after talking in the corner, Park Hyojin urged,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say? Why did he call?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wants to talk to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora glanced at their chief before replying,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do? I told him we\u2019d let him now soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what do we do? Of course, we need to meet him. Tell him we\u2019ll be out right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, then let\u2019s ask the makeup unni to fix our makeup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be good to look nice. You never know, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora took out a hand mirror from her bag and looked at her reflection.</p><br/><p>Soon, they went to their makeup artist.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cHere are the drinks you ordered.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee placed the teacup on the table and glanced at Jung Sunwoo. Her curious gaze also brushed back Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora who were sitting across from him. As soon as she left the private room, they could hear her conversation with her coworker.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he? Is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I think he\u2019s Jung Sunwoo. His face looks exactly like his pictures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, are the girls who came with him celebrities? They were pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was an article about him doing a show with a girl group. Maybe they are members?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, should we ask for a picture when they leave? I think they\u2019ll be famous once the show airs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Hyojin and Yoon Bora brightened when they called them pretty but immediately frowned. They heard this multiple times a day after Pretty Girls became a hot topic. \u2018Aren\u2019t they Pretty Girls?\u2019 \u2018No, they left the group.\u2019 \u2018Why did they do that? Fools.\u2019</p><br/><p>They heard this repeatedly, but it still lit a fire in their stomachs whenever they heard it.</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora gulped down the tea with a chamomile flower floating on it. Then she flinched before placing her cup down. Jung Sunwoo was observing them. Staring at them.</p><br/><p>Yoon Bora picked up a tissue and calmly wipes the corners of her lips.</p><br/><p>Sitting beside her, Park Hyojin looked like the most refined, elegant person in the world.</p><br/><p>However, their touching shoulders were stiff with tension. They overworked their brains thinking on their way here. What was so important that he had to talk to them face-to-face.</p><br/><p>Maybe he would ask them to appear on Making Film?</p><br/><p>Or, maybe, just maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>He was trying to gather all the members to make Pretty Girls whole again?</p><br/><p>Although Chief Lee Taeshin and the lawyer they secretly met shook their heads, maybe this person had a way. Maybe he could end their contract with NK Entertainment and bring them over to W&amp;U. Such expectations slowly budded.</p><br/><p>Soon, Jung Sunwoo lightly tapped the table with his thumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cI called you both because I wanted to talk to you in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at us, no, please speak.<sup>{1}</sup> You can also talk more casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had a fierce gaze, that was because he simply looked that way. His voice was as gentle and soft as a kitten\u2019s paws. Thinking that there was no doubt it would be something good, Yoon Bora sipped her tea with a smile.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo smiled as well as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever been sued before?\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> This is a bit awkward, but a more literal translation of Jung Sunwoo\u2019s line would have been \u201cI called you to see you and talk.\u201d Which makes her slip up more reasonable.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-159\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 159\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-161\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 161\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201432\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Songha and me?\u201d</p><br/><p>If this was a joke, it wasn\u2019t funny.</p><br/><p>-That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you! It was released without any notice!</p><br/><p>When I asked him a few more times because of how taken aback I was, Kim Hyunjo told me to check it myself and sent me a URL. When I clicked it, I was sent to an article. It was published a few minutes ago.</p><br/><p>{Exclusive} Lee Songha, Secretly Dating Manager Jung Sunwoo! Birth of a Celebrity-Manager Couple?</p><br/><p>What a pile of crap.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a tabloid using initials or a speculative article. Our names were placed directly in the headline. I thought they might have posted a picture of Lee Songha and me as evidence, but there wasn\u2019t anything like that. There were just a few lines of fiction.</p><br/><p>A fictional story about how Lee Songha and my love secretly blossomed.</p><br/><p>There was a part about how Lee Songha knew a lot of my personal information, like my birthday or hobby, during Star Manager. They also made it seem like her sticking to my back like a turtle shell foreshadowed our love.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat dumbass wrote this kind of article\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately checked the author.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daily Fact = Reporter Choi Jaemoon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Damn Daily Fact. It was the publication that had called my home and requested an interview. I was wondering why they were annoying my family, so it was to write this crap of an article.</p><br/><p>-The PR Team is trying their best to manage the situation, but it\u2019ll probably still spread quickly. Don\u2019t answer any calls from reporters, and immediately come to the company. I already told Songha to cancel her schedule and come over as well.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo groaned before asking,</p><br/><p>-Hey, but don\u2019t tell me-</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>-About this article\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an article. It\u2019s nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said this with a laugh, Kim Hyunjo\u2019s voice became lighter.</p><br/><p>I told him I\u2019d come back to work immediately and hung up. At the same time, Jung Hyesung, who came back from the terrace, sat down in front of me with smiling eyes.</p><br/><p>I cooled down what was burning up inside me with cooled coffee. If the woman in front of me wasn\u2019t there or if it wasn\u2019t for the paparazzi, I might have chucked my phone to the ground.</p><br/><p>I heard a courteous voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem? Your expression didn\u2019t seem very good while you were on the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bit. It seems something good happened on your side though, seeing as your expression is bright.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked back, Jung Hyesung\u2019s lips curled up slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Some new work came in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut moving on, umm\u2026 Chief, I have something I\u2019m curious about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice trailed on as if she was hesitating as she brushed her hair back. Her white neck was revealed below her jingling earrings. I could smell her sweet perfume even from here.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, do you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t because I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>My phone, which I had placed to the side, began ringing again. It would probably ring like crazy from now on. I muted my phone and shoved it in my pocket.</p><br/><p>The situation became urgent. Now wasn\u2019t the time a long conversation.</p><br/><p>If things were going to crap, I needed a card I could use immediately. For example, the Korean star being discussed as our male lead was, in fact, a time bomb. Everything would go to shit if he was cast.</p><br/><p>This quality information and some evidence.</p><br/><p>I licked my lips slightly and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Jung Hyesung, I also have a question I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared directly at Jung Hyesung who bashfully blinked her eyes.</p><br/><p>Then I straightforwardly asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a member of the paparazzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I quickly drove my car and returned to work. Unpleasant gazes landed on me.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was the scandal real? Is he really in that sort of relationship with Lee Songha? If they were, how far did they go?\u2019 Their gazes showed that they were dying to know the details.</p><br/><p>Nonsense was already spreading online.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was thanks to the PR Team\u2019s efforts, but the Detail Fact article came down immediately. Yet, social media was overflowing with screenshots made by quick-acting netizens.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s and my name were stuck in the real-time search rankings for a while now. Damn internet.</p><br/><p>Since the netizens were in a frenzy, other publications were constantly releasing spam articles as news. They were trying to get a piece of the pie since Daily Fact was the one who fired the shot, meaning they would be the first ones to be sued.</p><br/><p>I walked past them with a calm face.</p><br/><p>If I were to show my agitation, it would only serve to incite the shoal of piranhas.</p><br/><p>The fifth-floor PR Team office was no different from a contact center.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporter Kim, what do you mean fact? It\u2019s a story fabricated to spin controversy about these two because they\u2019re trendy right now. A press release will be sent soon so don\u2019t waste your time and resources.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be distributing a press release soon. Yes, soon. Since people need to hear their side of the story\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With one hand on their mice and the other holding their phones, Team Leader Park and the other employees were chatting away with agitated voices.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo and Team 3 Leader gestured towards me from their table.</p><br/><p>I approached them and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the press release not ready yet? Isn\u2019t it best to express our side of the story as quickly as possible in scandals?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, even if we said that the story was nonsense, netizens would argue whether it was a fact or rumor. Still, it would be much better than spending our time doing nothing like now.</p><br/><p>This was because it would look like there was a delay in confirming the truth if our reaction was late. That would make the scandal seem even more real.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe press release has been ready for a while, but we are waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo gestured upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil we get a call from the CEO\u2019s office. The man responsible for the Daily Fact article is currently in his office.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what was this?</p><br/><p>What did the Daily Fact reporter and CEO Baek Hansung have to talk about?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? This isn\u2019t something that the CEO needs to personally take action for, right? It\u2019s just groundless nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader said while crossing his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter talking with Daily Fact on the phone for a bit, he immediately set up an appointment and met with them. Seeing as even our legal team is in there, it seems he\u2019s planning on having Daily Fact make a correction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut will they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo asked as though they were in a meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cPublications would rather be sued for defamation than release a correction. Saying how that would be embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo snorted as he kicked one of the table legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it not embarrassing to write a fiction about a celebrity if they\u2019re bored? Don\u2019t they know how fatal a scandal is for a female celebrity? Those bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Songha taking so long? Try calling the recruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the Team 3 Leader\u2019s words, I called him using my phone, which seemed to be bursting with calls and text messages. While waiting after hearing that they had just arrived in the parking lot, the recruit sent me a text.</p><br/><p>-Chief, it seems that Songha is very angry. After seeing the article, her mood is as cold as Siberia. I can\u2019t even start a conversation with her.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was angry?</p><br/><p>If the recruit noticed and told me about it, then it must mean that it was very noticeable.</p><br/><p>I frowned without realizing it. I was already enduring my urge to call Lee Songha and ask if she was already since nothing good would come out of us calling each other right now.</p><br/><p>I waited for a bit while gripping my phone when Lee Songha entered the office. Her face was chillingly stiff, so much so that it wouldn\u2019t be odd if it chipped and ice fell. I could understand why the recruit sent me that message.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t look angry to me\u2026</p><br/><p>Rather, she seemed stricken with fear.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me she heard some nonsense on her way here? If I felt people\u2019s stares unpleasant, then for a celebrity, a female celebrity to boot, their stares must have been much more direct.</p><br/><p>Or did she read some awful comment online?</p><br/><p>I should have told the recruit to not let her check her phone. I clicked my tongue as I asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you surprised?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha sat across from me. She normally would have sat next to me.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because she was conscious of the scandal or acting cautiously in case Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader suspects, but she didn\u2019t even look at me.</p><br/><p>Since her current actions were even more suspicious, I tapped the table with my fingertips.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine since the press release will be released soon. It seems the reporter wrapped me into this because there was no one else, but, that could actually have been better. If he had wrapped another celebrity into this, it would mean two companies would have to make a press release, making it twice as annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed as if I was joking, and only then did Lee Songha look at me and reply,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t read what she was thinking this time.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader\u2019s gaze alternated between Lee Songha and me as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking for caution\u2019s sake, but there really isn\u2019t anything for me to worry about, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s all nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied first, and Lee Songha followed after while nodding her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no hints about this scandal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone. It\u2019s a bolt out of the blue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. A bolt out of the blue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha repeated once more. The Team 3 Leader nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s something that crosses your mind, tell us right away. If a photo pops out suddenly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s needs to be something for a photo to exist. There\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who had opened and closed her mouth, was late as she agreed.</p><br/><p>I added,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be easy to photoshop a photo like Mr. Sung Dowon\u2019s incident last time. I\u2019m with Songha so much that we\u2019ll be in a two-shot whenever they point a camera at us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. It\u2019s obvious for a manager and his celebrity to be close, yet it seems this happened because you both have such a close relationship. Some people in the company were concerned that it might be a little dangerous as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile we are close, we aren\u2019t like that. And we won\u2019t be in the future as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said with a laugh. Lee Songha nodded slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust stay quiet in the meantime. Even if it ends quietly, a scandal is a scandal. Even when it\u2019s not, there will be people who think that there is fire where there is smoke and the paparazzi might follow you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader nodded in agreement at Kim Hyunjo\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The Team 2 Leader, that bastard, seemed to think this was an opportunity and went to ask the CEO if we should transfer you to his team. He seemed excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yeah, I knew that would come up.</p><br/><p>It was the worst-case scenario I had thought of. Even if the scandal wasn\u2019t true, the company might not want to keep a risk as is. Although I expected it, I still ended up frowning.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader, I would screw him over big time one day.</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and looked at Lee Songha. I couldn\u2019t tell what she was thinking, but she had a serious look on her face.</p><br/><p>To be honest, there were times when I thought about Lee Songha in that way recently. I kept looking at her, suddenly thinking about her, and even though I told myself I needed to get it together or it would be troublesome, it wasn\u2019t easy.</p><br/><p>Still, I jolted to my senses because of this scandal.</p><br/><p>It would gloss over like this because I was the only one with a guilty conscience. If there really was something going on between Lee Songha and me, I didn\u2019t even need to see the future to know what would happen.</p><br/><p>I shrugged while saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a nothing incident, why are people reacting like that? It makes me feel like I did something wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but we\u2019re just nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I have no choice but to go on a few dates with a girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo chuckled lightly at my words. It finally looked like they cleared away all their suspicions.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even have a girl to go on a date with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do, I just don\u2019t have the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, how lucky. Just what-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cWe got a call from the CEO!\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park\u2019s voice cut the Team 3 Leader\u2019s speech.</p><br/><p>The office became silent. As soon as Team Leader Park hung up after a short call, Kim Hyunjo asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey decided that Daily Fact would make a correction! And we\u2019re going to release a press release with that in two minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are going to make a correction? What the heck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems things went well with the CEO. Anyways, it seems it\u2019ll finally quiet down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Songha. Songha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha, who was sitting somewhat gloomily, raised her head when Team Leader Park called her name.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe CEO said for you to come up for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pressed the elevator button and glanced beside me.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stood still as she stared at the electronic display.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing. Since there really wasn\u2019t anything, he\u2019ll probably just tell you to be careful of scandals and to not date anyone for the time being. If he says something else, just let me-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like this will never happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha said while slightly biting her lower lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t date anyone. I\u2019ll only work until I\u2019m successful so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The elevator arrived at our floor.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked at me while getting on the elevator as she continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m going to ask the CEO to not transfer you to another team-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be more suspicious if you say that. I\u2019ll be thinking about that problem as well so leave that to me. You don\u2019t worry about a thing and just come back. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said while waving.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked at me quietly until the elevator doors closed.</p><br/><p>I took my phone out once I confirmed the elevator stopped on the seventh floor. I called a phone number I had saved, and as soon as she answered, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Jung Hyesung. Should we make a deal?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-114\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 114\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-116\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 116\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201343\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

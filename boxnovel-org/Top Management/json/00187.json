I\u2019m confident in that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anyone else has prepared something, let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>As though they were at an audition, the girls showed their talents and conversation topics to Park Taepyeong. Even though he swore a lot, the goldfish looked less nervous than before. It was because Park Taepyeong still commented on and gave suggestions while swearing.</p><br/><p>They took a photo together at the end for Park Taepyeong\u2019s social media.</p><br/><p>There shouldn\u2019t be any problems with the broadcast with this.</p><br/><p>We returned to Pretty Girls\u2019 waiting room, and Chief Lee Taeshin said,</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, team leader. To come and help us when you\u2019re so busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>His glittering eyes were a bit too much. He looked tense in front of Park Taepyeong, who was known to be crabby, but now, he looked light as a feather.</p><br/><p>I tapped his arm and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to thank me. This is my job.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I greeted the staff and checked Pretty Girls\u2019 broadcast for a bit before leaving the studio. As soon as I got in my minivan, I took out my phone. Then I checked the countdown that was stopped at two.</p><br/><p>-Songha, do you have anything going on today?</p><br/><p>I received a reply as soon as I sent the message.</p><br/><p>-Yes, I have nothing going on today.</p><br/><p>-Let me know if something happens. Even if it\u2019s something small.</p><br/><p>-No way! You dictator!</p><br/><p>I stared at the screen when an urgent message arrived.</p><br/><p>-Seoyu nggu nni sent that.</p><br/><p>-Is Seoyoung alive?</p><br/><p>-No. I\u2019ll contact you even if nothing happens!</p><br/><p>After my conversation with the Team 2 Leader, I spent every day on high alert. It was as if I had returned to working with Choi Gunyoung. Just like when I had a bomb that would backstab me at any moment next to me.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t see any reason to light the fuse.</p><br/><p>At least for now.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Well-Made Production was still bustling.</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was an audition today as many people who looked to be managers and celebrities were present as well. A pretty woman clenching an audition script was crying in the lobby.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I think I might have bombed the audition. I really did work hard for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you worked hard. It\u2019s all good. You did well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we go ask them for another chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>The actress was crying while the manager tried his best to comfort her. This was a common scene at auditions. They practiced day and night for the audition, yet the audition would be over in an instant when they stood in front of the camera and director.</p><br/><p>The ones sighing as they left weren\u2019t only actors and managers. While there were directors who held grand auditions with dozens of participants, they were many unknown directors with ambitious scripts who left after only receiving a business card.</p><br/><p>There were a few celebrities and managers in the Content Business Production Department hallway. They were all staring at the drama and movie posters displayed on the walls. They were all projects produced by Well-Made.</p><br/><p>I too stopped in front of the poster at the very end.</p><br/><p>It was a Royal Family poster that was also hung up in my apartment.</p><br/><p>There were quite a few people murmuring to each other because I didn\u2019t have my sunglasses on inside. There were managers who approached friendlily, asking if we could get a drink sometime, as well as celebrities who gave me their personal phone numbers while their managers were absent.</p><br/><p>Someone grabbed my shoulder the second time I refused someone\u2019s number.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung! No, are you a team leader now?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Director Sung, who I had worked on Royal Family with.</p><br/><p>He guided me to a large meeting room. Director Sung personally made two iced coffees.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now, have some coffee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on for you to personally make coffee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith our relationship, does there need to be a particular reason for me to make you coffee? You helped us with Kim Dowon\u2019s drug scandal and with making Royal Family a success, and we also in your debt for many things, so I just made coffee without knowing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung said talkatively.</p><br/><p>Then he covertly slid a scenario in front of me. Checking it, it was a movie. We had been gathering scenarios, scripts and even foreign scripts for Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon\u2019s next project, but it was my first time seeing this one.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Director Park\u2019s new project? Why didn\u2019t I see this before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a project we\u2019ll be producing. We had already picked the leads and were auditioning for supporting roles. However, Shin Sora, the female lead, hastily quit the project.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lowered his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s three months pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shin Sora\u2019s not married yet. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any scandals either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Her company\u2019s just been hit with a bolt of lightning out of the blue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung clicked his tongue and continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we had a meeting with Director Park on who to choose for the new lead, and our opinions aligned, so I contacted you immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>I picked up the scenario. No matter the scenario, my heart always raced before I flipped the first page. The problem was that there were many cases where my emotions cooled as I flipped more pages. Still, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem with the quality if it was being directed by Director Park and produced by Well-Made.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back and talk with Songha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give it to Ms. Son Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you are in charge of Ms. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s next project. Is that not true?\u201d</p><br/><p>While I knew there were many people in this industry with loose lips, why did people outside the company know about this?</p><br/><p>Was this something to brag about?</p><br/><p>Anyways, I received the scenario. Director Sung, who looked at me expectantly, changed the subject,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still looking for Ms. Songha\u2019s next project? You probably received a ton though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are in the middle of internal discussions. It isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be good if she did her next project with the Royal Family staff near the end of the year. This time, as a sole female lead. Think about this. If Director Woo, Writer Jang, and Ms. Songha get together once more, investments will be pouring in and broadcast companies will open their timeslots.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied with a laugh.</p><br/><p>I had two or three meeting like this a day these days. With subcontract production companies, movie production companies, broadcasting companies, directors and writers. The majority were interested in Lee Songha\u2019s next project, but there were quite a few who handed scenarios and proposed auditions just for Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>The roles were incomparable to last year.</p><br/><p>But I didn\u2019t really like any of them.</p><br/><p>I received and read scenarios and scripts constantly, but I was always on a fence. When a decent project caught my eye, I always found more cons than pros. There wasn\u2019t one that I could immediately pick like Alive or Royal Family.</p><br/><p>Also, it wasn\u2019t like I had any hints like with Cat Guardian Ghost either. This was the reason why I had delayed picking Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon\u2019s projects.</p><br/><p>I asked each of them for their opinion. Lee Songha picked a few similar ones and was considering them, while Nam Joyoon just wanted to do all of them. He was someone with no desire for food but a ton for projects.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t extend their breaks continuously either, so I had thought I should pick whatever project Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon like the most out of the ones already selected.</p><br/><p>I looked at the scenario in my hands and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Sung, are there other scenarios and scripts I haven\u2019t seen like this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Jung, you\u2019ve seen tons of scenarios. You took most the scenarios last time you came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung scratched his thick chin and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones that you haven\u2019t seen are those that have already finished casting or ones we\u2019re quietly casting because the director and writer are picky. These are hard to get. There are also ones that have been shelved because they are problematic to produce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProblematic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike ones that are hard to get investments for because of the plot or ones that aren\u2019t of great quality. We particularly receive all sorts of projects for contents. There are many problematic ones like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould I take a look at them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung gave me a weird look.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really understand you as it\u2019s like someone ignoring a 100-dish meal and going to dig up their own vegetables in the mountain. Still, since it is your request. I don\u2019t know many of the first two types, but there are a lot of problematic projects.\u201d</p><br/><p>He got up and led me to the project storage room.</p><br/><p>The moment I stepped into the dark storage room, I was hit with the smell of old paper. The storage room was filled with bookshelves. Each shelf had bound scenarios and scripts, and there were boxes full of drafts, revisions, and proposals.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are these all projects?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese have accumulated for ten years now. But the ones that have been shelved have good reasons for that. If you\u2019re thinking about discovering a huge hit in here, you\u2019re wasting your time. The good ones have already become hits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Sung clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>I flipped through rustling paper as I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, it\u2019s great that there are so many to read.\u201d</p><br/><p>From that day one, I invested looking at projects whenever I had time. I went over to SBE Film, which produced Alive, and they had quite a few scenarios like that as well. That\u2019s why I went to whichever company was closer to look through projects when I had time during the day.</p><br/><p>While receiving looks indicating that it was the biggest waste of time in the world.</p><br/><p>Not just that, I examined amateur projects that came up in online scenario markets and asked around about directors who were famous for not handing their projects out to others. Usually, they were temperamental masters, so I didn\u2019t obtain much.</p><br/><p>During this time, the countdown was always at two.</p><br/><p>I checked Lee Songha\u2019s surroundings every day, but there weren\u2019t any problems. I tried learning something from Chief Lee Janghyun and Chief Jo, but nothing came out of it. Perhaps that day was productive. Maybe the Team 2 Leader pushed his plot aside because he believed me.</p><br/><p>Or maybe he was too busy and had pushed it aside momentarily.</p><br/><p>I saw quite a few empty seats at the late-night screening. A Hollywood movie that was released last week was garnering a lot of attention, so this movie had tough competition. Its posters and trailers were excessively trendy and childish.</p><br/><p>It was a romance, so that the majority of people in the seats were couples enjoying their dates. They were busy whispering to each other until the title screen came up.</p><br/><p>I waited for the movie alone.</p><br/><p>Then, two hours later, after the chatting audience had left and the credits were finished, I got up while holding a bottle of water. I shook it because I was thirsty, but it was already empty. As soon as I left the theatres, my phone rang like it had been waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>-I thought it would be over by now. Hyung, how was the movie?</p><br/><p>We had talked before I went in to see the movie, yet it seemed like he had been swallowing drily for the past two hours. His voice was rough. It was completely different from the movie just now.</p><br/><p>Listening to the nervous Song Inho\u2019s breaths, I replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was quite different from the scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, they changed a few parts. Because my scenes suddenly increased at the end. I don\u2019t know why, but my role became similar to the male lead. If the movie flops because of me\u2026</p><br/><p>I heard his suffocated breaths.</p><br/><p>I bought another bottle of water from the vending machine. I was so thirsty I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had thought that the project would be good if they followed the scenario as is.\u201d</p><br/><p>A couple was headed in my direction from the washroom. Their faces were flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cI picked it because it was a rom-com, but it really was good. Two hours went by in a breeze.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it was my first time I screamed from seeing a face in a movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s shocking even to men. He looks like he just came out of a manhwa.\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>Passing by the noisy couple, I continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe completed project is much better than the scenario. Much better. The plot and your role too.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Really?</p><br/><p>Song Inho\u2019s voice instantly brightened.</p><br/><p>I poured water down my throat. Just then, I received another call.</p><br/><p>I was Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hung up and answered Lee Songha\u2019s call. I had confirmed with her that nothing was going on today before I went to watch the movie.</p><br/><p>-Oppa?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, is something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes.</p><br/><p>I stopped before going down the stairs.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha spoke in a rigid voice.</p><br/><p>-It seems the Team 2 Leader called my mom.</p><br/><p>The lights that lit the stairs shut off. I talked to Lee Songha while standing rigidly in the darkness. By the time I hung up, the thirst had long since been sated. Something hotter burned in its place. The countdown was complete.</p><br/><p>The fuse has been lit.</p><br/><p>The moment I felt those flames, I was probably\u2026 smiling.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Korean comics, more similar to Japanese manga.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-186\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 186\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-188\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 188\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201488\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

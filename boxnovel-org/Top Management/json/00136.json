Many people are hotly anticipating Director Choi Sungwon\u2019s new project with its unbelievable cast! The Korean disaster film blockbuster \u2018Alive\u2019 began several days ago. Weekly Entertainment went on scene to get a peak. And now, we\u2019ll be interviewing the lead actors\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer! Producer!\u201d</p><br/><p>A panting production assistant shouted as he ran between the film crew members.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, can\u2019t you see we\u2019re filming the opening shot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, Lee Kihwan said he can\u2019t do the interview!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weekly Entertainment film crew were shocked by this sudden news.</p><br/><p>Soon, the head producer and reporter rushed to the lead actors\u2019 managers.</p><br/><p>Lee Kihwan\u2019s heavyset manager clicked his tongue as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard that today\u2019s film schedule has changed, right? But the scene they are filming now is an emotional scene for the lead actors. We can\u2019t have Lee Kihwan lose his immersion by doing an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, then what about after the scene-?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll end since there\u2019s a night scene too. We\u2019ll definitely do an interview the next time you come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a live broadcast tomorrow! If you do this suddenly, then our segment is ruined!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do interviews with other actors anyways. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager bowed then left.</p><br/><p>Frantic, the production staff hurriedly went to other managers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lee Kihwan isn\u2019t going to do the interview? Then I don\u2019t think we can either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur nuna has to focus for that scene too, and I don\u2019t even dare bother her right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were going to do it since other lead actors were going to do it, but now that\u2019s a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer\u2019s face had paled from the stream of refusals.</p><br/><p>The reporter, camera director, and the lighting director gathered around and grumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow petty. Even if they are top stars. How can they treat us like this on the day of the interview? Are they looking down on us because we are a freelance production? Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill we have anything for tomorrow\u2019s broadcast? Shouldn\u2019t we change our segment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s tomorrow? We have to squeeze out and broadcast whatever we have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can we fill the entire 20-minute segment with what we have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we asked the assistant director to try and persuade the actors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet he won\u2019t? He looks incredibly busy right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Weekly Entertainment production team were ripping their hair out, a staff member shouted into her walkie-talkie while running,</p><br/><p>\u201cMakeup is done for Ms. Lee Songha! Costume team, please come check!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter immediately said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been rejected by Ms. Lee Songha yet, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll do it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, wouldn\u2019t someone at Lee Songha\u2019s level give us an interview? She\u2019s a rookie.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer clicked his tongue in astonishment at the production assistant\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt Lee Songha\u2019s level? Even if she loses out in terms of level, she\u2019s currently the hottest topic right now. Cat Guardian Ghost craze has been going on for 2 months now. Even though the drama is over, the Chinese are still crazy about it. She\u2019s not the Lee Songha of the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the rumors, I heard she\u2019s not the temperamental type.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was before she became popular. Once they do, nine out of ten change completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEither way, let\u2019s go over there and beg. We can\u2019t let the segment fall through like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding onto this sliver of hope, the Weekly Entertainment production staff began to move. Just as they discovered the white minivan she was in, a man got out of the driver\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? That person\u2019s Chief Jung Sunwoo, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. He is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The camera director mumbled while looking at Jung Sunwoo\u2019s face,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks heartless. I think we\u2019ll be rejected as soon as we bring it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think we\u2019ll be rejected before we can even bring it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience despite how famous he is, right? It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s thirty yet either. Why does he feel more intimidating than other team leaders and directors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? It feels intimidating to go talk to him? I don\u2019t know why, but it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to his cold exterior or because he was known as Midas\u2019s Hand, a figure who had been mentioned constantly by the press two months prior, but Jung Sunwoo gave off this strange feeling that other managers didn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>After taking a deep breath, the producer walked over to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief! I am Producer Lee Chulsoon of Weekly Entertainment who contacted you previously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, hello. I heard that other actors have canceled their interviews.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer bit his lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, we can finish our interview in 5 minutes so is there any way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill only Songha\u2019s interview be broadcasted?\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer\u2019s eyes bulged at his calm reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-is an interview okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is. We already promised to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! We were worried that we would have to throw the whole segment out-!\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer gestured to the staff with a face that seemed to have just grabbed a lifeline.</p><br/><p>The reporter, production assistant, and staff gathered immediately. While they were quickly taking out their cameras and lights, Jung Sunwoo, who was rubbing his chin in thought, said,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut will you be fine with just Lee Songha\u2019s interview? I remember it being a 20-minute segment. You won\u2019t be able to show any scenes because they aren\u2019t allowed so all you have must be the couple shots of sketches on set.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 We\u2019ll try to reduce the length of the segment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like this, why not just fully focus on Songha?\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer, who had been sighing, abruptly raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll try to give you as much interview time as I can. Our PR Team can send you any material regarding Neptune or China. Although Director Choi Sungwon will be a bit tough, I can arrange a few staff members to give you some comments as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer\u2019s eyes moved quickly as he thought over it.</p><br/><p>Soon, after quickly making a call, he nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll embed Ms. Lee Songha\u2019s name in huge letters at the top of the screen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo\u2019s lips curled upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, producer! Producer! Look over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>The production assistant caused a fuss as he called the producer. The producer turned around, wondering what else had happened, when he stopped.</p><br/><p>It really was worth making a fuss.</p><br/><p>The camera director and lighting director next to him were astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, there\u2019s no need to worry about our ratings if we just show her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is why directors who have worked with Lee Songha constantly talk about her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the real deal. Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha followed behind Chief Jung Sunwoo.</p><br/><p>Her straight hair, half of which was tied up, fluttered in the air.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t seem to have any makeup on, yet everyone\u2019s attention focused on her. She wore a crisp, grey blouse with a white ribbon tie, a fully-buttoned, neat blazer, and an H-line school skirt.</p><br/><p>When Jung Sunwoo stopped, Lee Songha came out from behind him and smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I am Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we know Ms. Lee Songha! Your school uniform fits you dangerously well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter smiled friendlily as he handed her a wireless mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels odd wearing one after such a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you start by introducing your character?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Lee Yeonwoo, a high schooler. Uh, she\u2019s an elegant lady who grew up in a strict, prestigious family. Her dream was to be a gymnast, but she had no choice but to give it up due to her parent\u2019s opposition. A calamity struck one day as zombies suddenly appeared, and she does her best to try and survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have prepared various things to get into Lee Yeonwoo\u2019s role. If there was anything difficult\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s expression suddenly turned solemn. Her eyes became gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was terrifying. For the month and a half since I returned from China.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter also became serious as he perked his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t eat any snacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t anything I wanted to eat, and my trainer planned out a meal plan because I needed to build muscles to have the figure of a gymnast, but the food wasn\u2019t something a human should eat. I usually filled the ven glove box with snacks, but even those were snatched away. I was so hungry and sad that I couldn\u2019t sleep properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s eyes glistened with tears as she looked off into the distance like someone who had suffered the cruelest torture in the world. The reporter consoled her with an awkward expression on his face. The director filmed this scene while barely containing his laughter.</p><br/><p>After a few more questions, the reporter placed the bait.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of actors appearing in this movie, is there one that you are particularly concerned about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there is.\u201d</p><br/><p>She answered immediately.</p><br/><p>The reporter and producer exchanged glances as they silently shouted in delight. She had an actor she was concerned about. This was a bait that viewers couldn\u2019t help but be interested in. Whether it was an actress or an actor.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you tell us who it is\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was about to reply when she abruptly stopped.</p><br/><p>Then she looked at Jung Sunwoo who was watching her nearby. After asking for the producer\u2019s understanding, Jung Sunwoo approached her. Lee Songha said something to him in a voice so quiet it wasn\u2019t picked up by the mic.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, I\u2019m sorry, but it seems like we\u2019ll have to skip this question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon? It\u2019s not like we were going to come out with a provocative headline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not as famous as you might think. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo added with an odd look,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t filmed his first scene yet so it\u2019s too early to mention him like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The ENG camera<sup>{1}</sup> moved.</p><br/><p>The film set was a worn-down apartment. An enormous blue screen was set up around the building to add computer graphics later.</p><br/><p>More than a hundred crew members and extras crowded the area.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, please film some of those extras. The ones dressed up as zombies over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey look so real. I\u2019d be terrified if I saw them at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were people whose skin of their faces had ripped off, revealing the facial muscles underneath, and even those whose intestines were dangling outside. Everyone was busy taking selfies before the shoot.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt apparently took 5 hours per person to cover their face in silicon and apply special effect makeup. To be honest, I thought it would be a Hollywood knockoff since it was a Korean zombie film, but this gets my hopes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weekly Entertainment staff whispered to each other.</p><br/><p>The assistant director, who wore a walkie-talkie around his neck, approached them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that you cannot film the actual scene, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we do. We will only take a full shot of people getting ready for the scene and a few reactions from the crew during Lee Songha\u2019s scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cause a disturbance. Today\u2019s shoot is very important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Ah, but how much of the scene will Lee Songha be in? Considering she was comfortable doing an interview, it doesn\u2019t seem to be too important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant director frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. This is the most important scene for Lee Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to admire these jerks since they didn\u2019t give us an interview, but they really are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe energy is incredible since they only cast top stars. We needed to film this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weekly Entertainment staff whispered to each other.</p><br/><p>On top of cracked and crumbling concrete, Korea\u2019s top actors were immersed in acting with full film makeup and outfits.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrankly, what are we going to do if we save that kid when it\u2019s difficult for us to take care of ourselves!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to leave the kid there? He\u2019s crying! He\u2019s going to die like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone shouted while someone else cried tears of pity.</p><br/><p>They even began grabbing each other\u2019s collars. It was mayhem.</p><br/><p>They were on a manmade set with an enormous blue screen.</p><br/><p>There were tons of cameras and crew members. People surrounded them as they watched with interest.</p><br/><p>Even though the environment made it difficult to immerse oneself into the scene, the actors acted as realistically as possible. A camera chased this breathtaking scene in one take.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s a bit\u2026 It\u2019s reasonable that they rejected our interview for this. It really is an emotional scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut is it not an emotional scene for Lee Songha? She\u2019s so quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer looks are the best, but she doesn\u2019t stand out amongst those actors. Maybe it\u2019s because of her lack of experience?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha stood rigidly amongst the aggressively moving actors. Completely straight with her eyes slightly lowered.</p><br/><p>This made sense considering her character\u2019s background. A flower that grew up in a strict family. However, she was too calm. Only Lee Songha seemed like she was displaced from this devastating situation surging with disaster and conflict.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said this was an important scene for her, but is she fine with just that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s her role?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she lacks any presence. Doesn\u2019t she need to prove her skills in her next project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Only then will people stop saying \u2018she\u2019s a one-hit wonder\u2019 or that \u2018Cat Guardian Ghost was the peak of her acting career\u2019. But this is a bit\u2026 Is she having trouble acting? Maybe she can\u2019t get into her role because of her interview with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>As they discussed with worried faces, they glanced at Chief Jung Sunwoo and were shocked. Even though he should be the most worried about this, his expression was too calm.</p><br/><p>Rather, he was smiling as he watched Lee Songha act.</p><br/><p>That moment, an angry voice erupted from the set.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m some sort of psychopath for wanting to leave? We can\u2019t even enter that apartment, yet how are we supposed to save that kid on the fourth floor!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, let\u2019s first make a plan\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>A man, playing a minor role, left the crowd of aggravated people. Shaking his head, he walked next to Lee Songha. Then he wrapped his arms around her shoulders, almost in an embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do they still not understand the situation when the world is becoming crazier by the second? Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be in danger as long as you stick with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>A calm voice, unfitting of the situation, spoke out.</p><br/><p>Under the agitated people\u2019s gazes, Lee Yeonwoo said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI will bring that kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? The apartment is overrun with those monsters, zombies, or whatever they are!</p><br/><p>Lee Yeonwoo gently pushed the man aside and unbuttoned her school blazer. After taking off her vest as well, she undid her ribbon tie and placed it on top. She then untied her ponytail and retied it higher up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLend me your knife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Th-this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another minor role handed her his knife with a flustered expression.</p><br/><p>Lee Yeonwoo placed the knife under her skirt and ripped the right side of her skirt up to her thigh. She did the same to the left side. With a few unhesitant swipes of the knife, she revealed her milky yet firm thighs. The surrounding people made a commotion.</p><br/><p>Handing back the knife, Lee Yeonwoo looked up.</p><br/><p>Her resolute gaze landed on the fourth floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can bring him down without entering the apartment.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> ENG \u2013 Electronic News Gathering Cameras, heavier to dampen small movements</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-135\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 135\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-137\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 137\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201384\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

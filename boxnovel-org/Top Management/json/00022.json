You have a good eye. If there was just one that was really good, we could have just chosen that one, but since both are equally good, it\u2019s troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, they both would equally fail.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a bit cautious to tell you this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I gulped down my saliva.</p><br/><p>If we didn\u2019t consider that I knew the future, I was a new employee that has been around for less than a month and they were long time experts that had lots of experience with dramas and movies. I really needed to explain myself carefully.</p><br/><p>Good. Let\u2019s try my best to convince them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth have really good synopses, but there are some parts that concern me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, just who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyeong cut me off and asked Chief Jo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe says there\u2019s a part that concerns him. Just what kind of person is he that I have to listen to him pour cold water on my project I haven\u2019t even started? Whose manager is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune\u2019s manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune?\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyeong\u2019s expression immediately grew worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t actors, but singers. Idols. And I know their manager and this person isn\u2019t him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s a new recruit that just started.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNew recruit?!\u201d</p><br/><p>She crossed her arms and laughed as though she was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat knowledge would a new recruit have for you to bring him here? Are your senses deteriorating? Just listen to what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Chief Jo cut me off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe hit the jackpot as soon as he started working and has become Management Team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm. So I wondered if there really was something like beginner\u2019s luck and asked him. All for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell him to stop pouring cold water on my projects and to screw off. So annoying, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026</p><br/><p>The person synonymous with innocence turned to dust and scattered.</p><br/><p>I knew that a big part of an actor\u2019s image was made up. But to be told to screw off from an actress who I thought was so good that I went to see her movie three times at the theaters\u2026 It was quite shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could recover from the shock, Chief Jo tapped my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked you to pick one out of the two, but why did you have to overrate yourself and piss her off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped myself from speaking anymore and got up.</p><br/><p>Just do what you want.</p><br/><p>Mermaid out of Water? I don\u2019t care if that fails or not.</p><br/><p>After being told to screw off and hearing that I was overrating myself, I had no mind or loyalty to convince them any further.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t go straight to the office but came back outside. Then I went to the coffee shop, bought some coffee and made my way to the fifth floor.</p><br/><p>Until then I kept pondering.</p><br/><p>Although it was already spilled milk, as long as I had this ability, these incidents would constantly come up.</p><br/><p>Did I say it wrong? Was my method wrong? Then how should I have done it?</p><br/><p>The elevator doors opened to reveal a refined hallway. On each side, the walls were filled with frames. They were the pictures of all the celebrities in W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyeong with a bright smile, Song Dowon in the water gazing into the distance, among other countless actors that made up W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>There was even a frame with Neptune. An album cover with the now familiar faces clung together smiling. I stopped my steps in front of that frame before once again moving at a quick pace.</p><br/><p>The PR team office was at the end of the hallway.</p><br/><p>When I looked inside, I could see familiar faces between the partitions.</p><br/><p>The two people I ate kalguksu with in the future. The female and male employee were sitting next to each other while typing on their keyboards. And behind them was Team Leader Park whose disheveled hair indicated something wasn\u2019t going smoothly.</p><br/><p>I quietly placed a cup of coffee next to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. Have some coffee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?! What is this? Why coffee all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just craving for coffee, what luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Like I expected, their reactions were intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought it here because I had a favor to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park took her coffee and poked my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you heard a few words from Son Chaeyeong just now? Is it about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you\u2026 Ah, this was the PR Team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, sit here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male employee brought out a chair and sat me down, then massaged my shoulders as if giving me his support.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it shocking? Son Chaeyeong was a child actress.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he was cautious of his surroundings, he lowered his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t really have a time when she was unknown and since she was young, everyone around her spoiled her. That\u2019s why her personality is like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe thinks she\u2019s the best in the world and thinks her words are everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female employee complained. It seemed like the two had a lot built up. As soon as they started talking, Team Leader Park waved her hand and ended the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop chatting, this is a company.\u201d</p><br/><p>She told me as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go around talking bad about Son Chaeyeong just because you\u2019re mad. Since she still is our actress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I never had that thought. Since she was going to fail her drama soon anyways.</p><br/><p>Besides that, I was more interested in something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam Leader Park. Would I be able to get a synopsis?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s your favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one is it? What\u2019s the title?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the title, but it was written by a new writer, Hong Jumi. It\u2019s from a cable network.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park tilted her head as if she had heard something strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you had some concerns about the good synopses Son Chaeyeong had, why are you suddenly looking for a cable synopsis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it was a drama that would later become a nationwide hit, even becoming a huge success in China, and all the lead and supporting actors got their lucky break.</p><br/><p>What Son Chaeyeong had was something that only looked good on the outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me ask you first. Just what concerns did you have about the synopses? I read them and found both were good.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered what I would say before opening my mouth. Half sighing, half speaking.</p><br/><p>I probably wouldn\u2019t be told to screw off here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe synopses were good\u2026 But, I heard some bad rumors about the director and writer. That they had something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What was it? I haven\u2019t heard anything? Is there a tabloid circulating?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Team Leader Park asked with a confused expression, the two employees quickly searched the internet. Writer, director, among other things, but obviously there would be no results.</p><br/><p>That was probably right. Since it said that it exploded during the filming.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did you hear it from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, but it\u2019s reliable information. I was worried that that might badly influence their next project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Then what about Mermaid out of Water?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are so many fans of the original work and they are hardcore, too. I was worried that the drama would be influenced by them and lose its direction. The fans are quite fixed on who they want to be cast. They might ignore Son Chaeyeong\u2019s acting ability and unreservedly insult her by saying that she doesn\u2019t fit well with the character and that she isn\u2019t the one they wanted for the character. Since there have been many cases where that happened. There have even been cases where the fans turned their backs and the cast fell through.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thoroughly explained to make Team Leader Park and the employees understand.</p><br/><p>Of course, I excluded the part about seeing it all in the future to avoid being taken as a mental patient.</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park stared at me and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the type that constantly worries, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you can be worried. What do I do if there really is something going on with the director and writer of Time Slip and it affects the series? What do I do if the original fans of Mermaid out of Water abandon us? It\u2019s fine to worry about that. But you can\u2019t succeed if you\u2019re afraid of failure. We\u2019ll look into Time Slip. But why are you worrying about Mermaid out of Water? No one knows what will happen in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I die, the cause would be frustration.</p><br/><p>Jung Sunwoo. 27 years old. Died of frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more fans the original has, the greater affect promotions will have and the fans could even be the driving force for the viewership ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this how the barber felt when he yelled that the emperor\u2019s ears were donkey ears[1]?</p><br/><p>At first, I sighed, but after I cleared my mind and thought about it, I could understand Team Leader Park\u2019s reaction. If I didn\u2019t have a foresight ability, I might have reacted the same way if some said those words to me.</p><br/><p>Why do you worry before you even try? You should be thinking about doing well\u2026 Something like that.</p><br/><p>I might be the only person who could see the future. Because of that, I might be limited in what I can do but I still couldn\u2019t act like someone who didn\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>Anyways, let\u2019s stop with the worries that no one wants to hear.</p><br/><p>I stopped trying to make Team Leader Park understand and threw a bomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t have a good feeling about Time Slip and Mermaid out of Water. And my senses are very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park, as well as the two employees, laughed their heads off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Then do you have a good feeling about Writer Hong Jumi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. A very good feeling. I think that it will be a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I nodded my head, these people fell to the floor laughing. Okay, laugh as much as you want. If I could bring you happiness, that was fine.</p><br/><p>That was that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to read her synopsis; would it be possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s been a long time since I laughed that hard. I can get you the synopsis. As long as you are careful not to leak it out to the public, there\u2019s no problem in letting you read it. But, you\u2019re Neptune\u2019s manager. There\u2019s no one that acts there so what are you going to do with that synopsis?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was wondering about that as well.</p><br/><p>How could I use it well?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The W&amp;U CEO\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung, the Management Team Business Director and the Management Team 2 Leader. As well as Son Chaeyeong and her manager, Chief Jo, were sitting around the two synopses.</p><br/><p>It was the place where they would make the final decision for one of W&amp;U\u2019s poster actress, Son Chaeyeong\u2019s, new series.</p><br/><p>Team 2 Leader rubbed his beard and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the police officer character of Time Slip is more appealing. What do you think, Chaeyeong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Mermaid out of Water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime Slip is IBC. I heard IBC has a lot of major series coming out next year. Then there will be plenty of outstanding candidates for the best performance award. For Mermaid out of Water, I will be the focus and since PBS\u2019s lineup for next year is weaker than IBC, wouldn\u2019t I be able to expect an award if the viewership ratings are high?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung frowned when he heard her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could an actress pick her projects for an award? You need to think about it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did think about it carefully. I\u2019ve been with W&amp;U for so long yet I haven\u2019t received the best performance award. I need to get it next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team 2 Leader laughed and coaxed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you need to get it. It\u2019s time for our Chaeyeong to get the best performance award. This drama will be a definite hit so you just focus on acting and don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung who was drinking coffee nodded his head.</p><br/><p>If Chaeyeong brought an absurd synopsis he would have resolutely convinced her against it, but the synopsis for Mermaid out of Water was pretty good. It was actually the best along with Time Slip out of the synopses that were currently circulating.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Both the synopses are good and whatever one we pick will have its pros and cons, so choose the one you want to do most. With no regrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Byunghwan oppa, contact Mermaid out of Water and tell them I\u2019ll sign.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll make sure the conditions match your preference.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director who was only smiling broadly with no interference said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I heard that Team Leader Park from the PR team was saying how there might be something with the director and writer of Time Slip and that they were looking into it. They said Team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm told them. Although we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, it\u2019s still concerning. However, since we chose to do Mermaid out of Water, we don\u2019t need to worry about anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chaeyeong who was happily getting up became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam 3\u2019s Lucky Charm. He\u2019s Neptune\u2019s manager, why? Do you know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo read Chaeyeong\u2019s mood and replied carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe saw him in the lounge a while ago. I asked him which one he thought would do better since it looked like luck followed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, he looked at both synopses and abruptly said that although the synopses were good, there were some concerns.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI say! He said that in front of you and Chaeyeong? What a nonsensical fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said. He definitely has problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what did he say he was concerned about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry? I-I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t ask him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Jo was taken back and his words trailed off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have asked him. I\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector. Don\u2019t bring that up. I am still uncomfortable about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chaeyeong said unhappily. Team 2 Leader read her mood and loudly scolded for everyone to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because everyone is calling the fledgling, \u2018Lucky Charm, Lucky Charm,\u2019 he thinks the company is a pushover. Who\u2019s that bastard\u2019s superior? I think I have a talk with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, that\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chief Jo was about to answer, the director waved his hand and stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything and just let him be. Since that team is doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kind of guy usually creates big trouble later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a problem arises, I\u2019ll take care of it then. Now, let\u2019s get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director who calmed the situation was the first to get up.</p><br/><p>Just when the director was about to exit the office after Song Chaeyeong, Chief Jo, and the Team 2 Leader, CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s voice stopped the director in his tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat rookie. What was his name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Team 3\u2019s Lucky Charm rookie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what was his name? Jung\u2026 Ah, Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung mumbled the name a few times.</p><hr/><br/><p>[1] Children\u2019s tale. http://www.worldstories.org.uk/stories/story/88-the-king-with-donkey-ears</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-21\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 21\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-23\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 23\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201156\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

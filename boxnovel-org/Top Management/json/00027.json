For some reason, the acting lesson teacher who swore at Lee Songha was so busy that he wouldn\u2019t answer the phone.</p><br/><p>To be honest, my mind was a tangled mess long before this.</p><br/><p>I blankly stared up at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Just what kind of conversation were they having up there?</p><br/><p>Did Sung Dowon arrive?</p><br/><p>How was the situation progressing?</p><br/><p>In my head, I wanted to run up immediately, but I knew too much to do that. To be exact, I had a lot of snippets of information, but, because I wasn\u2019t certain, I couldn\u2019t open my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s try to piece things together as much as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>First, what I was almost certain about.</p><br/><p>Sung Dowon attended the perverted sex party as did the married woman, and the anonymous man approached W&amp;U through some newspaper company. The newspaper company demanded money if they wanted to quietly cover it up and W&amp;U gave the anonymous man money to shut his mouth.</p><br/><p>But then they said that it eventually came out in the news?</p><br/><p>Vulgar baseless rumors started to spread and the fact that W&amp;U tried to cover it up with money and that there was photo evidence revealing it, dropping Sung Dowon\u2019s public image to the floor.</p><br/><p>And not long after, the situation reversed. This was the critical point.</p><br/><p>I could assume that everything up until now was true. As it had come directly from Director Park\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Secondly, the information I obtained about Sung Dowon from the future with a bad signal.</p><br/><p>The fact that his acting career might have ended after falling for \u2018their trick\u2019.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s put that aside for now. As I haven\u2019t done anything to change this future yet.</p><br/><p>The nuance from their \u2018trick\u2019 as well as Director Park\u2019s words about how the situation reversed. Because of this, I was suspicious that this might be a trap set up by Sung Dowon\u2019s previous company, Pure Star Entertainment\u2026 But this was only my thought. I wasn\u2019t certain.</p><br/><p>It was this part that was frustrating.</p><br/><p>If I knew who the anonymous person was I could come forward right now.</p><br/><p>I hoped that I would see the future once again just before the incident occurred, but there were no hints of my foresight ability activating after making multiple different attempts.</p><br/><p>What could I say at this time?</p><br/><p>\u2018I think this is a trick someone cooked up to mess with Sung Dowon. I know this sounds crazy but don\u2019t believe everything that comes up and be suspicious of the possibility of a mastermind. There\u2019s photo evidence. Right? You have to be suspicious about that.\u2019</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t say this. It was simply too crazy.</p><br/><p>Above all, if this was normal, I shouldn\u2019t know anything about this situation. If they ask me how I knew there was a photo, I had nothing to say. Even if I assumed I could get away with it by lying, I had to lie within my bounds. Lies would breed more lies and it would undoubtedly turn into a snowball effect.</p><br/><p>Then let\u2019s change my direction.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though it might seem like it\u2019s the worst possible situation, it\u2019ll feel like a sudden shower once it passes. The situation will reverse soon. So there\u2019s no need to be so worried.\u2019</p><br/><p>No! These were words of a crazy person! I felt like I needed to tell them to use talismans!</p><br/><p>I was pulling my hairs, trying to come up with something.</p><br/><p>Should I just say I have a supernatural power? Though I am worried about the consequences, this was the easiest lie.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a bad card. Although I would be called crazy, if the events go on like I said, I\u2019d be reevaluated.</p><br/><p>The lead shaman manager. Haha.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprised, I turned around to see Kim Hyunjo standing there with a sunken face.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief. Hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to rest today, why did you come? You don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll have a break after today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had something to say to the girls so I came for a moment. But chief, why are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came here for a meeting with other chiefs, but it got pushed back. Quickly go home once you\u2019re done. The company is a bit restless today.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gulped down my saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of Sung Dowon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Showing a surprised face, he came close to me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know that? Don\u2019t tell me there have been articles?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I overheard some people talking about it in the elevator. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That moment.</p><br/><p>The foresight I had been waiting for activated.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that photo evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>With no time to adjust, I opened my ears wide to listen to Director Park\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Considering the fact that they opened with the photo, was this a continuation from before?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was photoshopped.\u201d</p><br/><p>photoshopped?</p><br/><p>As expected, they did something to the photo evidence!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s true Sung Dowon attended the party, they couldn\u2019t get a good picture. So they skillfully combined the pictures and because it was true that Sung Dowon attended the party, they realized this fact too late. Afterwards, W&amp;U sued the newspaper company for abusing them without proper investigation. Articles were deleted and they released the truth and caused a commotion. Back then, I too received tons of angry phone calls.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was almost complete. Now if only I could learn who was behind all this\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was the one who created the photo and did all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to kowtow in front of Reporter Song if it was possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it ended with\u2026 a fraudulent paparazzi created the photo and was caught trying rip money off of Sung Dowon and W&amp;U, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was how it ended that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When my future self agreed, Reporter Song tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, are you saying the truth is\u2026 different?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible behind-the-scenes story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mastermind behind all this was in fact\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact?</p><br/><p>\u201cSung Dowon\u2019s previous company.\u201d</p><br/><p>There we go!</p><br/><p>I knew it was like that. I totally knew it!</p><br/><p>I felt a refreshing sensation overcome me knowing that everything fell into place as I expected. It was sort of like guessing the twist of a movie long before it happened?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t this mean that even without my foresight ability my senses were quite good?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was Pure Star Entertainment? It\u2019s been so long that I don\u2019t remember too well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Park asked my future self.</p><br/><p>It was so long ago that she didn\u2019t remember? Pure Star Entertainment went under?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Pure Star.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat company had animosity towards Sung Dowon and W&amp;U. So they acted that way to tarnish their image.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, to go as far as to photoshop a photo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey probably never intended on revealing the photo to the public in the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was enough if Sung Dowon and W&amp;U believed them and followed through with the deal. Sung Dowon had a sex party with a married woman? If it was a tabloid, they could have covered it up, but they even had a secret deal to try to cover it up? That\u2019s bad. If articles came, then suspicions would become the truth and they would spread in an instant. It was quite an effective method. Even if it was revealed that the photo was photoshopped, it would have already tarnished Sung Dowon\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 So even if they tried to explain, it must have left an impact on Sung Dowon. Since you said he was a top star, if his popularity continued, I should know of him, but the name is unfamiliar to me. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve heard of it before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>I came to my senses as if a light went on in my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yeah, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s interests would be peaked if there were articles exposing a celebrity\u2019s personal life, but there wouldn\u2019t be much attention about an article on their explanation. Celebrities with bad rumors would come out to the public to explain, but there would still be people who believe those rumors.</p><br/><p>It required tremendous effort to repair that tarnished image.</p><br/><p>Then, to move this situation toward the best direction, I needed to stop it before an article comes up and before the incident becomes bigger.</p><br/><p>When was an article going to spread?</p><br/><p>A few days later? Or\u2026 maybe today?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, quickly go home and rest. I have work to do so I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief!\u201d</p><br/><p>I hurriedly grabbed Kim Hyunjo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, about Sung Dowon\u2019s incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo looked around before saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve heard but act like you know nothing. Don\u2019t get too interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s a bit fishy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe manager of Lemon Girls. Pure Star Entertainment, Sung Dowon\u2019s previous company\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy from before? What about him? Did you meet him again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I felt sorry about using someone as an excuse\u2026 No, I wasn\u2019t sorry. He picked a fight with me on the first shoot for Next K-Star and kept staring at me whenever I saw him afterwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen that person was picking a fight, he kept acting like he would get revenge, but it didn\u2019t seem like it was solely directed at Neptune. Do those unethical bastards at W&amp;U teach you to do your job like that? You\u2019ll wake up to your senses once you suffer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, it seemed like he had something up his sleeves.\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard that real scammers mixed 90% truth and 10% lies.</p><br/><p>Well, what could you do if the person who got picked on felt that way? Were they going to open my head and check?</p><br/><p>My heart was beating furiously, but I tried to keep as serious of an expression as I could.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something just the two of us should know. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo secretly clenched a fist once before getting up.</p><br/><p>We got on an elevator and went up. During the short time it took to get to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor, I organized what I would say. Perhaps it was because of the adrenaline, but my mind was spinning smoothly.</p><br/><p>Swish.</p><br/><p>The elevator doors opened.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-26\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 26\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-28\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 28\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201166\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

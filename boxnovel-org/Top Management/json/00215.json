They should be opening champagne thanks to the unexpected effective marketing strategy, but the mood was gloomy. It was because of Director Cha Jaeho, whose eyes glowered as he sat in the seat of honor.</p><br/><p>-Irritable Cha, what\u2019s got him all worked up?</p><br/><p>A female employee wrote on the planner of her co-worker sitting next to her. Her co-worker silently showed her his phone under the table. The article headline on it read:</p><br/><p>{City Jungle hits crowdfunding goal in 1 hour, breaking the previous record}</p><br/><p>Exchanging glances, the production employees tried to flatter Director Cha.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, why are you so concerned about City Jungle? They aren\u2019t even on our level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur breakeven point is 4.2 million, and our goal is 10 million. They will be over the moon if they reach 4 million with that film.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no comparing directors either. You\u2019re a master, and she\u2019s a greenhorn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, if not for Jung Sunwoo, City Jungle wouldn\u2019t have been such a hot topic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho, who seemed to relax at being called a master, grew sullen.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I not be concerned?! I\u2019m about to collapse from high blood pressure because of that bastard! Do you know what that Jung Sunwoo bastard said-!\u201d</p><br/><p>His employees perked their ears.</p><br/><p>Something scandalous was going on between W&amp;U\u2019s Jung Sunwoo and Director Cha Jaeho, and although everyone was hush-hush about it, they knew that Jung Sunwoo stabbed Director Cha Jaeho in the back because of it. This was because the director made several outbursts on set.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bastard, that cocky bastard said\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho opened and closed his mouth a few times before bursting into a tirade of curses.</p><br/><p>Then, soon, he turned around with glittering eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the marketing coordinator?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>-Has City Jungle not started accepting funds? Why won\u2019t my payment go through?</p><br/><p>-It\u2019s been sold out, dear customer. The exit is on your left.</p><br/><p>-LOL I was fortunate enough to do it as soon as they launched it. If not, I might have missed out!</p><br/><p>-Oh my god. I missed it because I was careless. I succeeded in buying tickets to a solo concert that sold out in a minute and never failed to sign up for classes, but how could I miss this?! I\u2019m speechless. q.q Why won\u2019t they take my money when I want them to!</p><br/><p>-Their original time frame was a week. Won\u2019t they increase the funding goal?</p><br/><p>-I thought everyone moved to Supernatural because that\u2019s all they were talking about. Were all those posts made by Heo Kakyung fans? Or was this the big picture of those who wanted to get rid of competitors?</p><br/><p>-I knew this would happen. Since crowdfunding became a hot topic because of Jung Sunwoo lol.</p><br/><p>-But do all you investors think you\u2019ll profit? Because it\u2019s Jung Sunwoo\u2019s film? Only a few crowdfunded films until now have profited. You guys are better off investing in shares.</p><br/><p>-I only put in 100,000 won. It said that I would receive a VIP screening ticket as well as a general advance purchase ticket, so I didn\u2019t think I would be losing much even if I lost all of it. Looking at other community sites, it looks like there are tons of people who invested 100,000 won.</p><br/><p>-I put in 1,000,000! To be honest, half because of expectations and half for fun.</p><br/><p>-2,000,000 for me! Half for never-failing Jung Sunwoo, half because I\u2019m Lee Songha\u2019s fan. Songha, let\u2019s get another hit!</p><br/><p>Carbonated bubbles surged up glasses. Having received soda, the employees were chuckling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not for the fact you\u2019re still working, I wouldn\u2019t have popped some champagne!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s get in the mood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this was a simple celebration at the office, the mood was as though we won the world cup. People chatted while pouring soda into champagne flutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the producer messaged me, I was like \u2018Is this guy on drugs?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy? On drugs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, it just doesn\u2019t make sense logically! It ended as soon as it launched!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe left our mark on the history of crowdfunding films! The Jung Sunwoo effect is incredible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you! It\u2019s more effective than bringing an actor in a star marketing campaign!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t even count the number of flutes that clinked with mine.</p><br/><p>Although I did expect a pretty decent result when I sprinkled \u2018investments\u2019 onto my special image, this was beyond my expectations.</p><br/><p>Soda instantly poured down my throat. My frustrations that built up from Supernatural\u2019s media manipulation was swept away. I was receiving tons of messages from W&amp;U too. Team Leader Park was laughing about how she missed her chance to invest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt still feels surreal to me. I asked a few of my friends to invest, but I guess I was worried for nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The film production company Forest\u2019s CEO looked partly out of it as he laughed. He didn\u2019t have any alcohol, yet his face was red. I looked at the employees behind him and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Director Oh Hyunkyung not come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I told her to come even for a moment, but Director Oh is really focused right now. She said that she would make a few adjustments after the feedback we received from internal screenings. She really looks\u2026 I can\u2019t even strike up a conversation with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled the film I saw at the screening. It made me lose my sleep for the next few days.</p><br/><p>Just then, SBE Film\u2019s CEO and project producer, as well as World Art Pictures\u2019 general manager, approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe platform is asking if we have any plans on raising our goal. They say that they are receiving a crazy amount of inquiries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe originally considered 300 million as our maximum. Is there a reason to be greedier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s true, but the public is so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>SBE Film\u2019s CEO and project producer licked their lips. World Art\u2019s general manager shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we raise the target, it\u2019ll put pressure on us internally. Also, on our partial investors.\u201d</p><br/><p>While there was a slight conflict of opinions, we eventually decided not to increase our goal. We were already fully enjoying the marketing effects of having reached our goal in one hour.</p><br/><p>The project producer raised his glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s an overwhelming victory for us in terms of crowdfunding! There are probably a few of you who couldn\u2019t get enough sleep from Supernatural or whatever, but now you can sleep easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughter shook the office.</p><br/><p>However, the smiles of victors quickly faded the next day.</p><br/><p>{Supernatural vs City Jungle}</p><br/><p>This title, which seemed for suited for the octagon, quickly spread.</p><br/><p>Strictly looking at the production scale, Supernatural should be competing with foreign films because Supernatural\u2019s scale was three times that of City Jungle. That was why the reporters writing those titles and the public weren\u2019t comparing the number of viewers.</p><br/><p>Profit.</p><br/><p>Among the two films that asked for crowdfunding, which one would pass their breakeven point and give their general investors a share of the profits? This was precisely the part people were excitedly comparing and discussing.</p><br/><p>The people from Supernatural skillfully brought in general investors who participated in the crowdfunding. Selling snake oil again about how they were making the film with the audience.</p><br/><p>City Jungle\u2019s marketing budget was small so we worked hard to market through our crowdfunding event, but Supernatural wasn\u2019t satisfied with getting the first taste and now was trying to suck our work dry.</p><br/><p>The marketing teams on either side clashed even more aggressively.</p><br/><p>The sparks ignited by Supernatural were enough to burn an entire mountain. In particular, general investors became passionate marketers and were competing on various fronts.</p><br/><p>Competition always sparked people\u2019s interest.</p><br/><p>On top of that, after the story about how Lee Songha was offered the position as the female lead of Supernatural but was filming City Jungle because of my decision was leaked to the public, people\u2019s interest shifted immediately.</p><br/><p>From \u2018Would Jung Sunwoo\u2019s next project, \u2018City Jungle\u2019, succeed or fail?\u2019 to \u2018Which of the two, \u2018City Jungle\u2019 or \u2018Supernatural\u2019, bring in higher projects?\u2019</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the 3scene interview you did last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park approached me. Her firepower was surging these days from fighting with Supernatural\u2019s marketing team, but today, she had a miserable expression on her face for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat special interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>3scene. It was a well-known national film professional magazine. One where film production companies and marketing agencies would do anything to put on the cover or do a special interview for.</p><br/><p>We gave up on getting the cover because a Hollywood series blockbuster was decided to be on it already. From what I remember, that was why we set up a photoshoot with Lee Songha, Nam Joyoon, Director Oh Hyunkyung, and me as well as a special interview.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid it come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt did. It did but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is\u2026 a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park handed me the magazine she had brought over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess they paid a ton for the advert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Supernatural, Director Cha Jaeho\u2019 was on the cover in huge letters.</p><br/><p>Along with a photoshoot of Heo Kakyung.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>I suddenly received a call from my mother in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>-Sunwoo, your film\u2026 City, City, what was it again? I keep forgetting.</p><br/><p>\u201cCity Jungle.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yeah, that. Do you not have any commercials on TV? I went to the hair salon today, and they were advertising Supernatural or whatever on TV. All the ladies were talking about how fun it looked and that they should go watch it once it releases.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe also advertised on TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>-You did? Why haven\u2019t I seen it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t buy a large volume, so we need to wait for the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Supernatural shows up whenever I turn on the TV. Young people can just look it up on the internet, but older people will probably have to see it on TV to know about it. Why didn\u2019t you buy more?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt costs a ton, mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Really? But I heard you raised 300 million? That\u2019s what your brother said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did. But playing a 15-second ad for a few days costs a few hundred million.\u201d</p><br/><p>-\u2026 Oh my, what robbers.</p><br/><p>While we were doing better if we looked at viral or word-of-mouth marketing online, we couldn\u2019t compare to Supernatural in just the sheer volume of ads.</p><br/><p>Autograph signing events, exhibition shows with the Supernatural cast, and campaigns or whatever.</p><br/><p>They hosted these large events every day.</p><br/><p>Supernatural\u2019s ads weren\u2019t just on TV or in newspapers but also on buses, the subway, theatre banners, online portal banners, and even walls outside. Supernatural ads were everywhere. Wherever I walked, wherever I drove, there was always an ad about the damn Supernatural film.</p><br/><p>It was just insufferable.</p><br/><p>The next time I saw Director Cha Jaeho was on the parking lot of a newspaper company.</p><br/><p>He seemed to have come for an interview as he was all dressed up. He frowned as soon as he saw me. Of course, my expression wasn\u2019t great either. We were no longer in a situation where we could exchange pleasantries, so we greeted each other with foul words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This competition isn\u2019t all that bad for City Jungle either, no? What is that, yeah, they are putting you on the same level as us. You are also receiving a lot of the public\u2019s attention. How about you do an interview with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho smirked like last time.</p><br/><p>I was about to pour out all the words I had been preparing for this moment when my phone rang. It was SBE Film\u2019s project producer.</p><br/><p>What the? Was this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?</p><br/><p>Even if it was not as big of news as reaching our 300-million-won crowdfunding goal in one hour, I picked up the phone hoping it was at least some good news. Like last time, his side was very noisy. They were causing such a ruckus that my eardrum hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed I wasn\u2019t the only one who remembered last time as Director Cha Jaeho\u2019s expression crumbled like he had swallowed a bug.</p><br/><p>I gulped before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Then I looked at Director Cha Jaeho and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do the interview by yourself. I, we might have to go to France.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-why France?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, we\u2019ve received an invitation. From Cannes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Cha Jaeho blinked.</p><br/><p>It looked like he needed some time to process what I just said.</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t plan on waiting for me. I felt like I had to hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I need to hurry up and leave today. Ah, I hope your interview goes well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I said this, Director Cha Jaeho\u2019s face turned sour.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-214\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 214\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-216\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 216\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201525\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

I should have thought it through before saying that.</p><br/><p>While I was motionless as if my brain was lagging, Songha dried off her sweat and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t act.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why can\u2019t you? What\u2019s there not to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>And W&amp;U would probably be able to push you in that direction if you want.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t act.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not doing it, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why can\u2019t you act?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you ask me why I can\u2019t\u2026 I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you are go\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched while I was speaking.</p><br/><p>When I saw Songha, she was staring at me as if I was some strange person. Keep it together. I couldn\u2019t confuse the future and the present. Even though in the future, they said Songha was good at acting and that it was the rediscovery of Songha, it might not be true right now.</p><br/><p>Then just what happened?</p><br/><p>What did we have to do for that future to occur?</p><br/><p>Did she start acting because her future as an artist was faint? No. Looking at how she said she couldn\u2019t act, it seemed like she had already tried.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had bad memories embedded in her. Just the word \u2018act\u2019 made her expression stiffen and above all, when she said she couldn\u2019t act, her tone was too resolute.</p><br/><p>Then was it through daily practice that she was able to progress from terrible acting to great?</p><br/><p>Or was she just a late bloomer?</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you learned acting properly? Who said you weren\u2019t good at acting? Could you maybe show\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was rapid firing questions until my last question trailed off. Since a while ago, Songha was looking at me while slowly packing her things. She put on her thick padded coat and her bag. Then she approached me who was blankly staring at her and bowed her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to go. Good night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she disappeared like the wind.</p><br/><p>\u2026What the. Did she just escape?</p><br/><p>In the end, I spent the rest of my night worrying.</p><br/><p>Just why did Songha show such a bad reaction when I asked if she wanted to act?</p><br/><p>And the audition video of Songha I saw in the future.</p><br/><p>Honestly, at that time, I glossed over it but no matter how much I thought about it laying on the bed, I found it strange.</p><br/><p>Unknown title, unknown director, unknown role, yet a closed door audition? Did people even audition like that in this country? How secretive was this project? And she wasn\u2019t even auditioning in front of someone but through a video?</p><br/><p>Just why?</p><br/><p>The more I thought about, my suspicions narrowed towards a certain direction.</p><br/><p>Keeping the scenario under a strictly maintained system as if it was a military secret. Songha fluently mixing Korean and English in her acting. The casting director coincidentally saw her acting as an interpreter gave her a chance to audition\u2026 if it was like that then maybe Holly\u2026</p><br/><p>No. Get a hold of yourself, you crazy bastard.</p><br/><p>My excitement went too far. It wasn\u2019t like it was the next town over?</p><br/><p>Even veteran actors who had spent ten, twenty years in the country couldn\u2019t easily dream of that place. Even though W&amp;U was knocking on every door, indiscriminately pushing their actors in minor and supporting roles, the reality was that it was like filling a bucket with a hole with water.</p><br/><p>But Songha?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s stop this silly sleep talking. I couldn\u2019t even sleep a wink.</p><br/><p>I rubbed my hands on my face and got up from the bed. The day had already started.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was the effect of Next K-Star but Neptune was appearing on a public network music broadcast. If we wanted to get them all dressed up to look pretty on camera, we had move quickly starting early morning. Well, I was now used to seeing the moon when I leave and the moon when I come back.</p><br/><p>On our way to pick up the girls, I asked Hyunjo the question I had been waiting to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief. About Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid she ever get acting lessons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyunjo chugged down a hangover relief drink and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at her appearance. Is her appearance something that falls behind others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you think we would have never thought of getting her to act?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, she got personal lessons.\u201d</p><br/><p>So she did get them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she wasn\u2019t to the point of receiving insults, we were looking into getting her in a leading role on a public network weekend drama but it didn\u2019t look like God gave everything to a single person. Apparently, Songha has no talent in acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think? Her teacher obviously. That person looked at quite a few of our girls. Bora, Suran, and even Chaeyeong received lessons from him. So we sent Songha to him but he apparently said that even though her face was pretty, it couldn\u2019t cover up her poor acting skills. And after getting acting lessons, Songha said she would not act.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unexpected. When you see their music videos, she looks like she would be good at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince music videos have no lines. Even I was a bit regretful and tried to convince her but she wouldn\u2019t budge. It seems like she lost all interest in that field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, she did run away as soon as I brought up acting yesterday.</p><br/><p>But in the future, Songha was definitely acting\u2026 good even. Then did that mean that there would be something that would change her mind later on?</p><br/><p>Anyways, it looked like I had to investigate further. I needed to finish my other priorities first.</p><br/><p>We picked up the girls at their apartment and went to the shop. From there, we drove for a long time and arrived at the Yeouido studio. Still, the scheduled time was later than Knet so it had been a while since the sky turned bright.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? It\u2019s Neptune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeptune. They appearing on Next K-Star with my bias[1].\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the fact that they got much more exposure through entertainment articles, more people recognized them than before. Although there weren\u2019t people taking their pictures and no one clung to them for a sign, I was expecting that day would come once they placed first on a music broadcast.</p><br/><p>After they introduced themselves to other groups\u2019 fans for a while, we entered the studio. The waiting room was the same size as the one from Knet. And having nothing to do but wait was the same as well.</p><br/><p>I prepared a lot after the last experience. A fully charged backup smartphone battery. I even brought a phone charger just in case.</p><br/><p>As well as an eye mask. On my first day, I was too excited and nervous to sleep but after a few days of being a manager, I became a master at taking naps. Now, no matter where I was, I could sleep anywhere. I could say I evolved to survive.</p><br/><p>When the time had come for them to greet their seniors, Seoyeong grabbed the back of Songha\u2019s neck. Then she said the words she constantly repeated since they arrived at the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha. Just because you\u2019re a regular member of an entertainment program now doesn\u2019t mean you can get on your high horse since it could mean trouble, okay? They will immediately gossip about us. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour face looks sullen if you just stay there, so stay conscious of your actions and smile. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know\u2026 Nagging all day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Songha lowered her head and mumbled, Seoyoung\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, we move together but if we do well in Next K-Star, we\u2019re going to get our own personal schedules as well. How could I rest easy if I let you go by yourself? If you\u2019re like this in front of others, you\u2019re going to be punished for having no manners and you\u2019re going to cry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I could memorize that repertoire.</p><br/><p>It looked like Songha gave up on escaping Seoyoung\u2019s nagging as she listened with a blank face. And Taehee and LJ stayed far away from them. Only when they entered another singer\u2019s waiting room did Seoyoung\u2019s background music like nagging stop.</p><br/><p>We went to greet each waiting room in turn and smiled when new groups and their managers came to introduce themselves. Now that they had a regular program, they were slightly more composed in front of these new girl groups. Somehow, I felt proud.</p><br/><p>Since I had already experienced this schedule before, time passed by like a stream. Hyunjo who was closely observing the traitor and me was happy saying that next time he could show up late to show his face.</p><br/><p>I rested until 12, then I went to buy their snacks. The traitor was the driver today, so it was my job to buy the snacks. Now that I knew the girls\u2019 preferences, I instantly picked everything out and was about to return to the studio\u2026</p><br/><p>What was that?</p><br/><p>In the corner of the hallway leading to the waiting rooms, Seoyoung and Songha, as well as three Sugar Cats members, were gathered. Now that we had some uncomfortable meetings, every time I saw our members with Sugar Cats, I became anxious. That one day it would explode.</p><br/><p>As the distance between us shortened, I could hear their voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha\u2019s the one usually in the center. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a bit more emphasis on Songha but since there\u2019s four of us, it\u2019s quite similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, you\u2019re the best as dancing and Taehee unni is the best at singing. And everyone knows that LJ is skilled at rapping. If you\u2019re going to beat your unnis, Songha, you need to try hard. You bring the team down so what are you going to do if people insult you for getting the center because of your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was she sarcastically saying that Songha was the worst at singing, dancing, and rapping in the team and that she got her center position because of her looks?</p><br/><p>I half-sprinted. I thought that they would exchange superficial greetings and go on their ways today. Perhaps it was because there were no cameras or people but there were thorns in their words. Not hidden ones, sharp thorns that stuck out.</p><br/><p>I thought it would be better to act like they were busy and bring them away.</p><br/><p>I almost arrived when Seoyoung smiled as she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. She practices a ton. I\u2019m worried that she might even quickly catch up to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. Your team members are really kind. We weren\u2019t that happy in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you had the center position, we weren\u2019t that happy.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>[1] Bias is what people call \u2018their favorite idol group.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-23\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 23\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-25\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 25\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201160\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

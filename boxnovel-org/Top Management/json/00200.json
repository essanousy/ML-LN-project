Sorry, but I felt this was urgent. I felt like it would take a long time to meet if I contacted you ahead of time. Busy people were normally like this. I\u2019m really, really sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>She gave off a much more cheerful impression than on the phone.</p><br/><p>She had short, round, tangerine hair and freckles on her cheeks. Her eyes curved into a slight smile, showing how sorry she was. I felt like there wouldn\u2019t be many who would rebuke her even if she suddenly came over without calling like now.</p><br/><p>I pulled a chair and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, please sit. But I was in the middle of work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re busy! I will explain everything in ten minutes. I\u2019m a master of presentations. I actually came to discuss the scenario we talked about on the phone yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung raised the scenario slightly before bringing it back down. I barely managed to prevent my eyes from reflexively chasing the scenario and forced them to look forward. Then, in an expression that showed I was neither interested or disinterested, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that. City\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJungle! I really wanted to show it to you because you aren\u2019t the type that cares about trivial things like whether it\u2019s being produced by a major or minor production company and whether it\u2019s being directed by a star director or an unknown one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou worked with a debuting writer from a new production company for Cat Guardian Ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt had a timeslot with TVL, and Lee Songha was an unverified rookie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather, Seo Jijoon, who chose Cat Guardian Ghost despite being a public network one-top male lead and having received many love calls for more well-known projects, was the type to only look at projects. Unlike me, Seo Jijoon didn\u2019t have the certainty that it would be a success.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, is that so? But even the projects you chose afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have been disastrous if Royal Family or Alive had flopped. That\u2019s why I was criticized for picking safe investments and accused of being scared of failing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung crinkled her nose as she laughed,</p><br/><p>\u201cI just tried to butter you up a little. Honestly, although all directors would say the same, I am certain that this movie will succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was also certain of that.</p><br/><p>That is\u2026 if the owner changed.</p><br/><p>I turned my gaze to the scenario.</p><br/><p>The scenario played the biggest role in the success of a movie. Then what was the probability that a scenario, which succeeded under one director\u2019s leadership, would succeed with another director, who hadn\u2019t had a box office hit? Obviously, it was less than 100%.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019ll find it hard to believe. I\u2019m not an appealing director. If I\u2019m being honest, I heard similar things from investors. That they would think about investing if I handed the reigns over to another director.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cOne failure is the end these days. It really is difficult for a director who failed three times to get any investments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you thought about handing it over to another director?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s my project.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung shook her head firmly. Her eyes shined with passion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I created thinking would be my last movie. I spent a year fixing and polishing the scenario and tirelessly tried to persuade investors. Now, there are investors that I have had positive discussions with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung revealed a proud smile as she spoke.</p><br/><p>I was curious where the scenario came from.</p><br/><p>I had initially considered the peaceful possibility that Director Joo Jaechan bought the rights to it from Director Oh Hyunkyung. However, after seeing her reaction on the phone and right now, she didn\u2019t seem like the type of person who would give it up easily.</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan from the future had said,</p><br/><p>\u2018I had a hard time getting that scenario in my hands.\u2019</p><br/><p>Did he use a high-handed method?</p><br/><p>Directors used to be an absolute authority in the past, but that was no longer the case. There were cases where they were chased out when their opinions clashed with production companies, and other cases where they were switched out for another director because they didn\u2019t fit the investors\u2019 preferences. There were even cases where they were rejected by actors. There weren\u2019t uncommon.</p><br/><p>Although she said that that she didn\u2019t even think about changing directors\u2026 I didn\u2019t know about that. In a time where even mainstay directors were removed for various reasons, I wondered how long an unknown director would last under the pressure of those with investment capital.</p><br/><p>My mouth suddenly went dry. Something bothered me.</p><br/><p>If the last future vision I saw was trying to say that I passed on City Jungle directed by Director Joo Jaechan despite knowing it would succeed\u2026 Then what was my reason behind it? Was it because of Director Oh Hyunkyung?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe engine\u2019s now running, so all we need to do now is drive. That\u2019s why we are in the process of casting our lead roles. Ms. Lee Songha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing my expression, Director Oh Hyunkyung made a hearty laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know she\u2019s busy. Of course, I do. Mr. Seo Jijoon and Mr. Im Joowon are busy too. I know that too. To be honest, I was thinking about someone else from the beginning. I think he\u2019ll fit well with the image I\u2019ve thought of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Oh Hyunkyung pushed the scenario towards me as she said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to propose this to Mr. Nam Joyoon. As the male lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease have a look. I am confident I won\u2019t make you regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Director Oh Hyunkyung made her leave, I was left with the scenario in my hands.</p><br/><p>I somewhat cleared my disorderly mind in the meeting room before getting up. I was about to go down the stairs with the envelope containing the scenario when someone followed me. He had curly hair, which reminded me of squid tentacles. It was Chief Yoon.</p><br/><p>He glanced at the scenario and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour meeting seemed to run a little long. Are you perhaps interested in that project?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you interested in it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Yoon denied in an exaggerated manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was simply curious. I know that you have been looking at all sort of scenarios, but I was wondering if you had the leisure to spend time on movies that may or may not even make it to production.\u201d</p><br/><p>He coughed before whispering with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I was just wondering if it is really worth your time. People have been whispering about how you are acting like you\u2019re looking for scenarios and are, in fact, delaying making a decision because of the pressure of being a team leader. But who did that scenario come for? Ms. Lee Songha? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s Jijoon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have something I\u2019m curious about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout me? Well, if you have something, ask away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have work to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Yoon abruptly stopped in his steps. He blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I am working? I have an audition for Director Kang Minshik\u2019s project in the afternoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you would spend the time spent on me on preparing for that audition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Yoon\u2019s face flushed red.</p><br/><p>I went down the stairs. No one followed me this time.</p><br/><p>I got in my minivan. I glanced at the passenger\u2019s seat multiple time on my way home. It was the City Jungle scenario I had thought about countless times over the past few days. I tapped the steering wheel with the tips of my fingers. The traffic seemed to be especially slow today.</p><br/><p>I had thought about slowly reading through it after returning home.</p><br/><p>However, I found myself parked in a nearby parking lot.</p><br/><p>Exhaling, I picked up the envelope. I took out the scenario, and there was a colorful handout between its pages. It was a casting proposal.</p><br/><p>Along with a black-and-white photo of Nam Joyoon, Director Oh Hyunkyung wrote long, detailed, desperate, and embarrassing paragraphs on why she wanted Nam Joyoon as the male lead.</p><br/><p>Soon, I put the proposal back into the envelope.</p><br/><p>I then flipped over the first page of the scenario.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Something shook in front of me. It was thin, curly, and wet with something white.</p><br/><p>It was cream pasta.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park asked as she waved a forkful of pasta in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I was lost in my thoughts for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eyes are muddled. Maybe you\u2019re still not well? The director said that you could hand urgent matters to others and take a break. Why is someone who fainted and was in the hospital yesterday at work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had something I had to handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lost your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack when you were a road manager\u2026 Back when you were always taking naps in the company sleeping quarters, you said that you would live like a human once you become a chief or a team leader. That you would enjoy your private life and take vacations. But why does it seem like you have less time now?\u201d</p><br/><p>I did say that.</p><br/><p>As a road manager, whose day started and ended with driving, I had thought that thing would get easier once I became a chief. When I was a chief, I had thought that I would be able to enjoy life more if I became a team leader. How was it that it felt like I was gradually becoming the company poltergeist?</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, you reaped the rewards for your investments. Promotion and fame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park shrugged as she added,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Power, huh? It sounded so unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably realize it as you work. Though, you probably won\u2019t need to realize any more fame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to avoid that now. After going to the hospital, my every move is being watched. I suffered all morning. I think if zombies somehow entered our company, they would receive less attention than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you wanted to talk outside than at work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park looked through her eco-bag and took out a green envelope.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Joo Jaechan. He received a mise en sc\u00e8ne award at a short film festival not too long ago. Did you meet him then? I guess he left quite an impression?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI quietly looked into him, and it seems he\u2019s been receiving some love calls after receiving that award. They are more about commercials and music videos than movies though. However, it seems like Director Joo Jaechan wants to make a movie with his scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a historical drama called \u2018King\u2019s Warrior\u2019. He\u2019s been going around looking for a company to produce it. He\u2019s been rejected by all the major ones and has been working to persuade smaller companies. Their reactions are lukewarm. I asked a production company he approached, and they say that the numbers just aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park\u2019s eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re interested in that scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I did slowly read through it with some expectations, it wasn\u2019t something that really caught my attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. If you were interested in that, I would have told you to go back to the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park seriously seemed relieved as she let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not the scenario, are you interested in the director? Or are you interested in the short film that won the award? Do you want him to director Neptune or Pretty Girls\u2019 next music video? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re planning on giving a director who hasn\u2019t even made his debut a movie to direct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more I investigate, the more he doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of director you really want to work with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park flinched.</p><br/><p>Then, with a face that seemed like pasta was caught in her throat, she stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s similar? You want to have this director direct a movie? No, wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her gaze scanned me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of project is it? So you\u2019re interested in something? I did think that your expression seemed similar to when you bought Cat Guardian Ghost over. You made others wait in impatience. So what project are you interested in? Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park asked like she was dying to know.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know once things are clear. It\u2019s too early to tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you in the middle of tug-of-war with them? Problem with the role? Signing fee?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park, who kept asking questions, gulped down a cup of cold water as she asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me ask you one question. Who is the project for?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was the one who flinched this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha? Mr. Nam Joyoon? Jijoon? Mr. Im Joowon? Or Song Inho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Team Leader Park\u2019s face approached mine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-199\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 199\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-201\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 201\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201510\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

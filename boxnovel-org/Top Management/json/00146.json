His name is DOM\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDomi?<sup>{2}</sup>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDOM. He\u2019s an unknown songwriter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin laughed like he heard some amazing joke.</p><br/><p>DOM, huh?</p><br/><p>I had heard most songwriters while preparing for Neptune\u2019s mini-album last time, but it was my first time hearing this name.</p><br/><p>Still, since I knew his name, I could probably figure out his contact info with a few calls\u2026</p><br/><p>But what would I do when I have it?</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve already finished the guide track so what was I going to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too difficult to get songs from famous songwriters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin continued to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we rush over because they tell us they have a song for us, it\u2019s usually a song that has been rejected constantly over the years. Ah, of course, we\u2019re grateful even for that. There have been cases where songs like that became hits. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He lowered his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t bear the costs. We don\u2019t even have enough money to prepare outfits so the girls have been repairing them on their own.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bitterness flashed on his smiling face.</p><br/><p>Because he kept scratching his hair, it looked like a rat\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Neptune has their own songwriter, you probably don\u2019t have to hunt for songs anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze momentarily fell on Lee Taehee.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoyal Family OST is still first. I\u2019m been listening to it nonstop as well. The OST was so good, I wonder how great the album will be\u2026 If you have any songs left over, could you let us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin waved both his hand when he saw my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no, I\u2019m always speaking nonsense like this. You must need a ton of songs for Neptune\u2019s full album so there\u2019s no way any songs would be leftover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to speak,</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty Girls! Where are you? You have to be on standby now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-yes! We\u2019re coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Taeshin quickly gathered the Pretty Girls members at the staff\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, then we\u2019ll be taking our lea-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould I get your business card?\u201d</p><br/><p>I held him back and handed him my business card from my wallet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have time, I would like to grab a few drinks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, of course! Any time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyes bulging, Chief Lee Taeshin accepted my business card. Then he fumbled through before handing me his. The staff calling for Pretty Girls began to sound irritated. Mouth opening and closing, Chief Lee Taeshin rushed over to the staff.</p><br/><p>I looked at the card in my hand. It felt like more like Pandora\u2019s Box than a business card.</p><br/><p>One that contained blessings and evils.</p><br/><p>Tightly gripping this thin piece of cardstock, I turned around.</p><br/><p>A Pretty Girls member glanced at me as she passed by.</p><br/><p>The moment our eyes met, my vision swam.</p><br/><p>What the heck?</p><br/><p>My ability didn\u2019t activate no matter how much I begged it, and now it activated twice in a row.</p><br/><p>Without the time to think about it, I concentrated. I could see a computer screen through my static-filled vision. My fingers slowly rolled the mouse wheel. Straining my eyes, I recognized what was on the screen.</p><br/><p>It was an article.</p><br/><p>There was a picture. It was the girl just now. The Pretty Girls member.</p><br/><p>I scrolled down. A caption was boldly printed under the picture.</p><br/><p>{Pretty Girls Jung Jei feels undeserving of her title, \u201cThe Second Lee Songha\u201d}</p><br/><p>My feet seized. I stood in the doorway again.</p><br/><p>My eyes looking back at Jung Jei.</p><br/><p>Albeit slowly, my mind had been working until now, but it seemed to have finally broken down. The caption still lingered in my eyes.</p><br/><p>The Second Lee Songha?</p><br/><p>She\u2019ll be called that? Her?</p><br/><p>She gave off a milder impression compared to the overwhelming Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because of the mole next to her eye, but she had a wistful yet attractive\u2026</p><br/><p>I was examining her face, but she suddenly stretched her hand out.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you give me one too? Your business card?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice dragged me out from my thoughts.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung was crouching next to the sofa as she looked up at me. She looked nervous and restless. She put so much strength in her eyes that her eyelids were trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe child who you gave your business card to is only 22 years old!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? She\u2019s only a year younger than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a child! Since you\u2019re 29, oh my god, there\u2019s a seven-year difference!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I don\u2019t thi-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were in elementary school when she was born!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was probably in preschool.\u201d<sup>{3}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cThen when she was in middle school, you were in the army! An army mister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t give me any time to think.</p><br/><p>With a quick sigh, I looked around. It seemed Lee Kwanwoo and the stylist had left as I only saw Lee Taehee and LJ. Both were staring at me with their earphones out and phones down. They stared at me like they were observing me.</p><br/><p>But why were there only three?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did Songha go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The heck?</p><br/><p>Lee Songha was sitting right next to me like some earthbound spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sitting next to you for a while now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuahh, this is big. A big problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Making a fuss, Im Seoyoung grabbed my knee.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, were you the time to fall in love at first sight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea what the heck you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you want to date her or anything, right? When she\u2019s seven years younger than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does age got to do with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha hastily joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no order to marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not this. What I mean is why does age matter when you\u2019re going to age at the same rate? It wouldn\u2019t matter if there was a seven or even a seventy-year difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA seventy-year difference probably won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha blankly opened and closed her mouth at my words. She didn\u2019t seem right. Her dark eyes were moving quickly as her brain churned.</p><br/><p>LJ casually said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, age doesn\u2019t matter. But she looks too much like a minor. Songha, when you\u2019re next to her, she looked so much younger than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do look old for my age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha nodded her head in agreement.</p><br/><p>I was so dumbfounded that I laughed.</p><br/><p>Thinking this was an opportunity, Im Seoyoung added,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She looks like a minor. If you date her, you\u2019ll be handcuffed\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, acting like this to me, is an illness. Also, who\u2019s going to date who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou gave her your business card!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so we\u2019re dating if I give her my business card? There are probably hundreds of people in this industry that have my card so am I King Uija<sup>{4}</sup>? I just gave her one. You all have my business card too. The one I gave you to commemorate me becoming a chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis. I have it right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha looked through her bag and took out a business card. My business card.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you carry that around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have another at home. This is my lucky charm when I\u2019m on the go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha put the business card back and stretched her hand out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a new one too please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you already have two. Why another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe design seemed to have changed when I glanced at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t really understand, but I was used to it now.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why are you collecting different designs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung unni collects dolls with different faces too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung was dumbfounded as she shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Songha, how dare you compare that to this! The details of my dolls are completely different!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe details on these are very different too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha firmly kept her hand out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give me one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s valuable or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen two please.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave her all but one of my cards in my wallet. The corners of Lee Songha\u2019s closed lips kept creeping up. She wasn\u2019t the type to express her happiness when companies sponsored shoes or bags that cost tens of millions of won, yet here she was. Maybe I should hand out my business card whenever she feels down?</p><br/><p>I leaned against the sofa with this foolish thought.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lee Kwanwoo and the stylist arrived with snacks. The waiting room became as loud as normal. Lee Taehee put her earphones back in her ears, and Im Seoyoung mumbled her lines. Lee Songha was standing in a corner practicing their choreography.</p><br/><p>There was only one person still staring at me.</p><br/><p>LJ kicked the floor. Her chair wheeled towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just telling you this for your own good. Don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ came close and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cFall for temptation.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t know why LJ said that to me, it fit perfectly with my situation.</p><br/><p>As I really was suffering from temptation.</p><br/><p>Two snakes perched on each on my shoulders and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u2018Just swallow it. You can do it. It\u2019s not like they officially started recording.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018And what if it rots inside you. You might really become a piece of trash in the future.\u2019</p><br/><p>It felt like their forked tongues churning my brain.</p><br/><p>It was the same even if I took a cold shower. It didn\u2019t clear my mind. It only resulted in goosebumps. I couldn\u2019t act rashly. A single step. It felt like I was standing a crossroad where a single step could change everything.</p><br/><p>At some point, my alarm rang.</p><br/><p>I took a break from my worries and moved.</p><br/><p>The day was brightening outside my window.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung, why do you look so haggard? Did you have a hard time falling asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>The SBE Film project producer asked as he stuck his head out from the back seat of the bus.</p><br/><p>Not only did I have a hard time falling asleep, but I didn\u2019t sleep at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer, your face is all puffy. Did you not sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep a wink. It\u2019s always like this for me the day before a release. I always get nightmares if I fall asleep. Like the opening scores crawling along the bottom or hearing people talking badly about the movie while I\u2019m in a stall. Stuff like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone on the bus was similar. The actors, managers, and staff, who had gathered for the commemorative shoot, were all nervous and tired wrecks. In fact, even Director Choi Sungwon was yawning nonstop.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m with you, but it feels different from the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>The project producer said in a joking manner.</p><br/><p>People sitting close to us joined in,</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead of praying to God, Buddha, or the gods of heaven and earth, I might start praying to Chief Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Sunwoo, don\u2019t tell me you poured all your luck in Royal Family. You left a little for us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you sense anything about today\u2019s results?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a shaman.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff laughed with rigid faces at my words.</p><br/><p>I looked behind me. Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon were sitting next to each other amongst the actors. Within this mood of excitement and nervousness, only they looked calm as a pool of water. An employee from SBE Film was filming the actors.</p><br/><p>The bus stopped in front of the Yeongdeungpo multiplex cinema. People were gathered here to see actors enter as it seemed they failed to get tickets for the screening where the actors greeted the audience. There were even DSLRs with huge lenses.</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Kihwan! Oppa, you\u2019re so amazing! Please go in slowly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Park Saeryung! Her face is the size of my first\u2026 Oh my god, hey! It\u2019s Lee Songha! Look at her face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing! We\u2019ll definitely go watch your movie! We\u2019ll watch it ten times!\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard excited voices in the crowd. The actors were in the middle as the staff and security escorted them inside. As the people here were experienced with events like this, they smoothly arrived in front of the theatre showing Alive. Looking inside, it was already packed with people.</p><br/><p>With Director Choi Sungwon at the front, Lee Kihwan and Park Saeryung entered while waving their hands. The theatre erupted. Screams and cheers echoed. I saw a few of these before, but they weren\u2019t as intense as this one. Well, the cast was simply too splendid.</p><br/><p>I said to Lee Songha,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting here so good luck with your lines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha went in with steadfast steps. Even though it was her first time attending an event like this, she didn\u2019t seem nervous at all. Well, she did perform in front of thousands of people and went around to market her drama. She was no longer the rookie who would be startled by a few hundred people.</p><br/><p>I turned my gaze and looked at Nam Joyoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHope you have a good time, hyung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going because you told me to, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me. SBE requested this. To go to these stage greetings.\u201d</p><br/><p>After scratching his neck, Nam Joyoon walked in front of the audience seats.</p><br/><p>It would have been great if they entered after the movie, but since this was an event before the actual screening, the audience\u2019s reaction was relatively lukewarm. They were clapping out a respect, thinking he was an actor since he came at the end of the procession.</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue in regret when Nam Joyoon suddenly stopped. His surprised eyes locked on a single spot. Curious, I checked to see if people he knew had come.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long. In the middle of the audience, a handful of familiar faces sat in a row.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Guide Track \u2013 Track that roughly lays out the structure of the song.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> It could sound like \u2018Domi\u2019 to Jung Sunwoo because of the actual sentence structure here. Also, Chief Lee Taeshin gives him a more Korean pronunciation after.</p><br/><p><sup>{3}</sup> So FYI, Koreans count age differently. Koreans consider themselves 1 when they are born.</p><br/><p><sup>{4}</sup> Legend/myth where he had 3,000 court ladies</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-145\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 145\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-147\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 147\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201404\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

However, there was only one role and multiple people who came to mind.</p><br/><p>An actor\u2019s future could hinge on a single project.</p><br/><p>Who should I give a project guaranteed to be hit and who should I give a project likely to be a success? This was a consideration that I had never encountered back when I was only managing Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon. If there were other choices, I wouldn\u2019t have to think this hard.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 Who was the actor originally picked to star in City Jungle in the future?</p><br/><p>I buried the thought that crept up my mind.</p><br/><p>First, it was more urgent to focus on what I know what could be.</p><br/><p>I needed to handle the matter of ownership of the City Jungle scenario. I clearly laid out what I had to do. I created a straight path that would lead me to the future I wanted.</p><br/><p>Also, before taking my first step, what I had been waiting for finally opened.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee gave a longing look toward the Team 3 Leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one glass. Just to ease the nerves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEase your nerves with beer or something. This isn\u2019t alcohol you open for any occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader, who was sitting in the living room sofa, hugged his glass bottle even harder. A moderately thick root was submerged in a long, slender bottle. This was the wild ginseng alcohol he had gifted Neptune every time they made some big accomplishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the real deal. When I dug it up, I resolved myself to not open the bottle unless something incredible happened. I\u2019ll only open it if your songs line up on the music charts.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls\u2019 expressions became lukewarm when they heard him.</p><br/><p>Line up on the charts.</p><br/><p>It referred to when the tracks of an influential singer\u2019s comeback album swept through the charts. There were even cases where boy groups with huge fandoms and great artists known for their hit songs had their tracks fill the top ranks for the charts.</p><br/><p>This was too difficult for us to dare dream about.</p><br/><p>Internally, we would consider it a great success if at least three songs made it to the top of the charts. After a long discussion with the A&amp;R Team about Lee Taehee\u2019s songs, we decided to go with a triple title track album. We spread our promotional marketing between them and even filmed three music videos, so I was inwardly hoping that all three would make it onto the first page.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to take it back if we don\u2019t get a line up? Aren\u2019t you being too cruel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung said with a face like she was looking at a scoundrel. A few voices chimed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe brought it over, but he\u2019s hesitant to give it to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, is that really wild ginseng? It looks like a bellflower root.\u201d</p><br/><p>The higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment. Everyone was trying their best not to get their hopes up. Our goal was being a moderate success or something. Still, they kept looking at me for a while now, so my cheek muscles were about to spasm from maintaining my smile.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people who would be frightened if my expression didn\u2019t look good.</p><br/><p>I took out a can of beer from the fridge. Pulling the tab, I looked around the living room. Lee Kwanwoo was tirelessly refreshing the page on the laptop on top of the table. Neptune, the Team 3 Leader, and Kim Hyunjo were forcefully releasing their tensions while glancing in Lee Kwanwoo\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>And, while all this was going on, Lee Songha was holding onto the script and scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am thinking about my next project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can think about that in a situation like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha nodded seriously. Her eyes looked like they were looking at a hit list than projects.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find a good project, so just wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, that\u2019s fine and all, but the album\u2019s out now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha hastily got up when she heard me. Immediately, an ear-piercing scream echoed in the living room. Someone was screaming while pointing their finger at their laptop screen. Someone else was screaming while waving their phone. Everyone\u2019s reaction was to scream.</p><br/><p>I shook my beer can amidst their screams and sincerely laughed.</p><br/><p>The Team 3 Leader didn\u2019t hesitate to open the wild ginseng wine.</p><br/><p>The top three places on the music chart were all Neptune\u2019s songs.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. It\u2019s very comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could sitting in a Rolls Royce be uncomfortable?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you keep sighing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sighing because I\u2019m uncomfortable. It\u2019s out of admiration because of how incredible the car is.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, my body was comfortable, but my mind wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung\u2019s uncomfortable words and the problems with the Team 2 Leader tangled in my head. This was despite the fact that Lee Songha explained how there was no problem with CEO Baek Hansung and CEO Baek Hansung had never mentioned the matter with the Team 2 Leader since then.</p><br/><p>Encountering him was uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I buy you one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe car.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung said lightly. Like he was giving out a piece of rice cake.</p><br/><p>Coughs erupted from my throat. It was a very enticing rice cake, but I didn\u2019t want it since it would be a headache to digest. It felt like I was taking out an extravagant loan.</p><br/><p>While I rejected his offer by saying that I loved and would continue to love the minivan I was driving now, the Rolls Royce arrived at our destination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will lead you to the reserved room.\u201d</p><br/><p>We followed a Korean restaurant employee over an arched stone bridge. Fancy carps the size of my forearm leisurely swam in the pool below. A willow grew above it, completing the picturesque scene. Beyond the garden was a traditional Korean tiled rooftop.</p><br/><p>It was so extravagant that it could be called a palace than a restaurant. I had gone to many hotel restaurants, which I would never go to if I had to pay out of my own pocket, due to work, but the view here was the best. It was a bit of a waste to use it only as a restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about to make that expression?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking that we could sponsor this place for a historical film set.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung chuckled in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be many opportunities for you to come here from now on. This place has quite a few regulars.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said whilst gesturing with his chin. Other guests were coming out the other side.</p><br/><p>They were older men. Most of their faces were familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know any of the faces there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI recognize most of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I had seen them in interview articles.</p><br/><p>The CEO of World B Pictures Korea, a movie production and distribution company. The director of the large entertainment, SoNaMoo. Besides them were executives, like CEOs and directors, from large and small management companies.</p><br/><p>They seemed to have recognized CEO Baek Hansung as their pace quickened as they approached us.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I was mistaken, but have you come to nourish your health during these dog days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve already eaten and are on your way out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have great if we ate together. The timing wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the scales were different, they were all people who represented their respective companies. I didn\u2019t know what they were thinking inside, but they acted in a very friendly manner to CEO Baek Hansung. There were even a few who seemed to have a hard time approaching him.</p><br/><p>This was enough to show CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s influence in our industry.</p><br/><p>After greeting them, CEO Baek Hansung placed his hand on my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this is Team Leader Jung Sunwoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I greeted them, intrigued gazes landed on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we know you. You are famous in our management industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hear it\u2019s because of you that W&amp;U\u2019s image has been great these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that Neptune! People are talking about how great their songs are. Congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed they had a few drinks while nourishing their bodies as their reactions were a bit exaggerated.</p><br/><p>I matched their ill-mannered remarks while thanking them. They say that you improve the more you do it. I seemed to have learned the ways of the world while working as it was easier to talk to people.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be great if I had someone like you working for me. If you have any thoughts of moving, contact me at any time. Don\u2019t worry about CEO Baek Hansung. Our company is growing so if you join now, you\u2019ll be one of our early employees. Our employee benefits are decent too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t know how great their benefits were, reading the mood, I didn\u2019t think they were.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions became awkward when they heard the new management company CEO\u2019s words. They glanced at CEO Baek Hansung, who was talking to the World B Pictures Korea CEO.CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s gaze met eyes as he glossed over it with a laugh. Like he had heard a light joke.</p><br/><p>Soon, people treated the remark as a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to make dibs based on the person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you even make dibs on CEO Baek\u2019s person? Especially a junior he personally brought here to nourish his health?\u201d</p><br/><p>While it was said in a joking manner, there seemed to be a meaning behind those jokes.</p><br/><p>We separated after saying our farewells. Behind us, the new management company CEO\u2019s voice was carried by the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I make a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to watch the mood before you do. Team Leader Lee Jangyeob\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 Leader?</p><br/><p>I tried to listen in on them, but their voices quickly grew distant.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou worked hard making Neptune\u2019s official album a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung commented after we had finished half the samgyetang<sup>{1}</sup>.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe girls, the Team 3 Leader, and Chief Kim Hyunjo worked harder than me. As well as other employees.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was all Lee Taehee\u2019s work that the title track ended up so good. It was the Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo, who took the lead by saying that Lee Taehee\u2019s songs were great when I was uncertain of their success. The album was only complete with the collective hard work of the employees, including the A&amp;R producer and PR Teams.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good comment\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung nodded as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking about talking to the PR Team and setting up a personal interview for you. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA personal interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk about Neptune\u2019s album on behalf of the company. And about your next projects. Voices wondering how you\u2019ve written a success story with no failures have even reached my ears. There are a lot of reporters who bluntly ask about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said as though he was enjoying himself.</p><br/><p>I saw a few as well. Reporters who were more interested in my first project as a team leader and which actors would join it over Neptune\u2019s new songs. It seemed like the entertaining rumors of Midas\u2019s Hand were growing exaggerated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get messy once reporters publish assumptions on what project you\u2019ll pick. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for you to do an interview before then? But you\u2019ll have to first decide on what your next project will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>His leisurely voice pushed my back forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a project I am considering serious. It\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCity Jungle?\u201d</p><br/><p>My chopsticks slipped from the plate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you there are no secrets in this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung lightly shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should forget about the project and look for a new one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read a lot of scenarios. There will probably be some projects you\u2019ve singled out. Discuss with the other chiefs and pick out around five projects. If you bring them to the next meeting, we should be able to pick one out, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you say forget about City Jungle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly as I said. I don\u2019t think it is suitable for your next project.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said firmly. Only then did what CEO Baek Hansung said organize in my head. Yeah, I knew that there were many who would oppose City Jungle if I brought it up. It looked shabby compared to the other promising works.</p><br/><p>I would have to persuade them eventually.</p><br/><p>I put down my chopsticks and wet my throat with cold water.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it isn\u2019t an eye-catching project, the scenario is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I read it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He read it?</p><br/><p>\u201cI was curious because it was something you were interested in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Did you not like the scenario? Although it doesn\u2019t meet the trends, it definitely is an entertaining project within its genre. Its production may seem uncertain, but once the cast is decided, there will be investors lining up, so there will be no concern it will be killed off due to a lack of investments.\u201d</p><br/><p>It would proceed even smoother if I used my fame.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that it has the highest potential for success amongst all the scenarios I have considered as my next project. I had thought that I couldn\u2019t lose Cat Guardian Ghost when I read it, and I get the same feeling from this.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was trying to persuade him, CEO Baek Hansung calmly looked at me with a smiling face. He occasionally tapped the table with his fingertips as though he was reacting to my words. After a good while, he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scenario wasn\u2019t bad. Like you said, it isn\u2019t what\u2019s trending these days, but noir works are rare in the country and it\u2019ll be good to widen our actors\u2019 spectrum with its charming characters. It is worth taking the risk if the actor is willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung continued to speak positively about it. He seemed like he was going to allow it, so his next words were more dumbfounding.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, look for another project.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice and expression were still gentle, but his voice was firm.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>Did his trust in my judgment hit rock bottom because of rumors that I had a panic disorder? Or was he unhappy that I rejected Telepath, which he had personally mentioned?</p><br/><p>While I thinking with a confused mind, CEO Baek Hansung tried to comfort me,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to lose out on City Jungle, then hand it over to another team\u2019s chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Another team? Why do I have to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t understand it at all.</p><br/><p>Why was it not okay if I wanted to do it, but okay for some other chief?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a situation where you should be stopping at nothing to find a project that will be a success. I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s no need to pick a project with high risk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause, Team Leader Jung, you cannot fail.\u201d</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> Chicken soup with ginseng and other medicinal ingredients.

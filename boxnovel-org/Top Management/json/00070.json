Whoever that insider is, considering he said it as if it was definitive, he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s an insider on our side. Gunyoung says that someone might have overheard Simon Lee and him talking at the Next K-Star set.</p><br/><p>I abruptly recalled today\u2019s events as well as the look the traitor gave me.</p><br/><p>That moment, a suspicion that the Music World of Revenge insider might be related to the traitor crossed my mind since he would want Simon Lee\u2019s song to become the title track. If he leaked this to the press first, then the company would have no choice but to consider Simon Lee\u2019s position as well.</p><br/><p>-From what Younghoon hyung says, it seems we will hold an internal staff meeting tomorrow with the A&amp;R team<sup>{1}</sup> and decide as quickly as possible. If we tried to drag it on and revise the story, then Simon Lee, who has actively gotten involved, might feel weird.</p><br/><p>Then Simon Lee\u2019s song becoming the title track was only a matter of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill this affect our double title track strategy?\u201d</p><br/><p>I perked my ears and looked at the rear-view mirror.</p><br/><p>My gaze met with Lee Taehee\u2019s in the mirror. Unlike me, whose expression was stiff with anxiety, she gave me a calm look.</p><br/><p>-I already told Younghoon hyung that you passionately pushed Taehee\u2019s song as part of double title tracks. You already have a past record of pushing Cat Guardian Ghost and getting good results. Either way, it won\u2019t take long so just wait a little.</p><br/><p>As soon as I hung up the phone, Im Seoyoung asked as if she\u2019d been waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, we might go with double title tracks? You\u2019re talking about the song Taehee unni made, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for certain. I\u2019ll let you know when things are decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left it at that and parked the van at their residence.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung and LJ rushed out, and Lee Songha, who kept giving me a worried look, seemingly finding my expression serious, said goodbye and left.</p><br/><p>Now, only Lee Taehee remained.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni, what are you doing? Aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go first. I have something to say before I go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee said, looking in my direction. The girls revealed suspicious expression but nodded their heads without probing further. Only after the two girls dragged the slow-walking Lee Songha did Lee Taehee open her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for today. We suddenly made work for you when you should have been resting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? It\u2019s nothing. You girls must have been shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had forgotten what had happened just a while ago because I caught up thinking about the article.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should have been more careful, but it seems I was caught up in the mood. It was the first time so many people recognized and approached us out on the streets as well as said that we were Neptune.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee\u2019s lips rose into a gentle smile as if she was recalling the events.</p><br/><p>Looking back at me, Lee Taehee continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish that people will call us Neptune for a long time. For that, the next album needs to do well. I don\u2019t have any other desires. So if you are pushing double title tracks for me, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard what Hyunjo oppa said.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked back at her, Lee Taehee was smiling beneath the dim lights.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be happy if the song I made was even put in the album. Even if it doesn\u2019t become a title track, I won\u2019t be so disappointed that I\u2019ll fall into a hole of despair or become an alcoholic or anything like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said, mixing in a joke with her gentle voice.</p><br/><p>With complicated thoughts, I replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. To me, your song is better than Simon Lee\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I thought that you said that simply as a compliment last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her slender eyes closed slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. For thinking of it like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I could, I wanted to tell her.</p><br/><p>I wanted to tell her that, in the future I saw, Lee Taehee\u2019s song was the song that represented Neptune.</p><br/><p>If I hadn\u2019t changed the present and, through this, the traitor didn\u2019t bring Simon Lee\u2019s song over, she would have encountered this future without any problems.</p><br/><p>When I thought this, I resolved myself that I would do whatever I could to correct this path that had gone awry.</p><br/><p>When the day brightened, I headed to work with a combatant mindset.</p><br/><p>Then, as soon as the team 3 leader arrived at work, I stuck next to him.</p><br/><p>If I tried to persuade staff members who I wasn\u2019t really familiar with, I felt like they would call me crazy and beat me up so I decided that completely persuading the team 3 leader was the best I could do.</p><br/><p>There was the thing with Cat Guardian Ghost as well. If the team 3 leader thought that my senses were decent, he wouldn\u2019t completely disregard my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, no matter how much I think about it, I think now\u2019s the best time to release Taehee\u2019s song. If we push double title tracks with Taehee\u2019s song, when they go on entertainment shows with Simon Lee, it can help support a more singer-songwriter, artist-like image. It\u2019ll really nail in their image as a talented girl group\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I spilled everything I had thought of all last night. The team 3 leader, who had been listening with a tired expression for a while, waved his hand. Then he crossed his arms and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, really. Do you really like that song that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Not just me, the other girls really like it too. Especially Songha, she said that the song felt like it was Neptune\u2019s and that she felt she could sing it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>I even tried persuading him by bringing in Neptune and Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader scratched his patchy beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I got it. Last time, you were obsessed with Cat Guardian Ghost, and this time, it\u2019s Taehee\u2019s song. I also feel like I shouldn\u2019t ignore your words because of last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really think it can be successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to push for double title tracks as much as I can. But if the other staff members\u2019 opinions are different, then there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat on a terrace from where the meeting room could be seen and stared at the meeting room door.</p><br/><p>I kept thinking about it in my head. If the results of the meeting weren\u2019t good, what would I have to do?</p><br/><p>I thought of all sorts of crazy things.</p><br/><p>Should I really act like a shaman? I even thought about telling people that I sensed that Lee Taehee\u2019s song would be a hit, very seriously. I didn\u2019t know how far rumors about me would spread, but there might be a staff member, like the team 3 leader, who felt like they shouldn\u2019t ignore my words.</p><br/><p>I pressed hard on my temples.</p><br/><p>I felt that I, in my current position as a manager who had only been working for a few months, was powerless. If I stood in a position where I could choose and decide on everything, I wouldn\u2019t have to agonize over this so much.</p><br/><p>While I was still immersed in my thoughts,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re still thinking about Taehee\u2019s song.\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly heard a voice. The traitor was sitting in the chair across from me.</p><br/><p>My mind was already complicated, but when I saw the traitor\u2019s leisurely face, my mood hit rock bottom. Why did his face look even better than yesterday? Well, of course, it did. Due to the article published yesterday, Simon Lee\u2019s song being the title track was pretty much set in stone.</p><br/><p>A sudden question crossed my mind.</p><br/><p>The future where the traitor pushed and succeeded in making Lee Taehee\u2019s song a title track.</p><br/><p>Was Lee Taehee\u2019s song part of the double title tracks in that future?</p><br/><p>The traitor continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you insist on pushing for double title tracks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer song\u2019s good. There are a lot of singers who put out double or even triple title tracks if the songs are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied while brushed my tangled hair.</p><br/><p>The traitor revealed a strange expression before shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I think it\u2019s better to push one that is certain to succeed. It\u2019s better to focus our energy into one. If we took a risk and it fails, then they both might end up with mediocre results.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne that is certain to succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that Simon Lee\u2019s song will become Neptune\u2019s first hit track. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing for a bit, he continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that my senses are right this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traitor gave me a bright smile.</p><br/><p>That moment, I had a sudden urge to wipe his face from my sight.</p><br/><p>How long had I waited?</p><br/><p>The door to the meeting room opened. The staff members who had attended the meeting bustled out. I shot up and approached the team 3 leader. The team 3 leader, who had been scratching the back of his neck, clicked his tongue when he saw me.</p><br/><p>Damn it. It didn\u2019t end well.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone agreed that Taehee\u2019s song was good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader said while patting my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut an article that we were working with Simon Lee had already been published, and they asked why we should insist on dividing the public\u2019s attention with double title tracks when we already had a song that would be a hot topic. That\u2019s why the meeting leaned towards the opinion of putting Taehee\u2019s song on their next album. There was nothing I could do.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no other way using normal means.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought that I only had crazy options left, the team 3 leader mumbled,</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless the CEO tells us to go with double title tracks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe CEO?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned my head and asked, the team 3 leader licked his lips and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they say the CEO arrived not too long ago, it\u2019ll be decided once I tell him and he makes the final decision. But it\u2019ll probably end up like that. Like Blackout\u2019s album and Neptune\u2019s last album, he usually leaves it up to the staff.\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s face crossed my mind.</p><br/><p>Then I also recalled how he had personally called me. He had suddenly asked whether I thought Cat Guardian Ghost would do well in China. He had also said previously that he had to keep lucky people close.</p><br/><p>Maybe, just maybe, if he saw me before he made the final decision on Neptune\u2019s next album, he might ask me for my opinion this time as well.</p><br/><p>Also, one more thing.</p><br/><p>I also recalled him saying that he would do something for me if Cat Guardian Ghost became successful. Since I was gnashing my teeth at Son Chaeyoung and Teacher Shim Kyungtaek that time, I had told him that I hoped Son Chaeyoung would pay the appropriate price for her deeds.</p><br/><p>However, the current situation was more important than that.</p><br/><p>I swallowed my saliva and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader. Could I come with you when you go to the CEO\u2019s office?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader glanced at me, seemingly at loss for words, before slapping my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a troublesome guy. Have you become so daring after entering the CEO\u2019s office a few times? Is the CEO your friend? No way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my mouth shut and simply stand behind you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said no!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader shook his head and disappeared towards the sixth floor by himself.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t understand him. If I was him, I too would have wondered just where this crazy guy came from. However, even if it was crazy, I had no choice but to do it if it could possibly connect the present to the future I saw.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a long while, I took out my phone.</p><br/><p>I found the phone number I had saved previously.</p><br/><p>It was a phone number that had called me once. It was CEO Baek Hansung\u2019s personal number.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung gazed at the synopsis on his desk with a strange look.</p><br/><p>It was the early synopsis of Cat Guardian Ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes this look like a drama that will be successful?\u201d</p><br/><p>At his question, the director who had been drinking black tea on the sofa shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust looking at the synopsis, it looks like a project from a newly founded production company. Well, if the script and the characters weren\u2019t okay, I couldn\u2019t have even suggested Jijoon do it at all. Also, to be honest, I thought that their target ratings would be 5% after reading the script.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what did he see in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung mumbled with interest.</p><br/><p>Just then, accompanied by a knock, the team 3 leader entered the CEO\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO, the staff meeting regarding Neptune\u2019s next album title track has ended just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a lot of talk about what sort of strategy we should take with Simon Lee\u2019s song and Lee Taehee\u2019s song, but the opinion that we go with Simon Lee\u2019s song as the title track this time was-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was Jung Sunwoo\u2019s opinion?\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO Baek Hansung abruptly asked.</p><br/><p>The team 3 leader blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>After tapping his desk a few times with his fingers, CEO Baek Hansung asked once more,</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Sunwoo. I\u2019m curious what he chose.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1} </sup>Artists and Repertoire Team \u2013 Responsible for scouting talents and overseeing the development of recording artists and songwriters (Wikipedia)</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-69\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 69\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-71\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 71\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201253\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

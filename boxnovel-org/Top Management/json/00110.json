Her pale lips opened and closed. She even pointed at him with her trembling hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTra, tra, tra-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTra?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTraitor!\u201d</p><br/><p>My brain stopped working. I never thought I would be called that.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-how could you do this?! How could you, oppa?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Calm down. Just what did-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cH-how can I calm down in a situation like this! Look how you say it so nonchalantly! Oppa, isn\u2019t this to-too cruel? And they say there you can\u2019t trust anyone in the world! You not even human! Damn world!\u201d</p><br/><p>So what kind of situation was this?</p><br/><p>Why was she freaking out so much? Were my words something that could rile up a storm like this?</p><br/><p>I was certain that the girls were clearly shocked. Im Seoyoung tightly held both my forearms and shook them while shouting about how I could have done this. If someone saw this, they might think that I sold my country off.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee and LJ didn\u2019t look like they were going to stop her either. Instead, they were looking at me with severe expressions as though I had actually betrayed them.</p><br/><p>And Lee Songha\u2026 Why was she so mortified?</p><br/><p>While she didn\u2019t freak out like Im Seoyoung, her state was even more serious. Should I say it felt like she might flop on the ground and slam at it at any moment? Or that it looked like she might transform into an evil spirit if I left her alone?</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had something she wanted to say to me, yet for some reason, she seemed to be enduring it while crushing the plastic sports drink bottle in her hand.</p><br/><p>I glanced at Lee Songha before asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all like this? Say it so that I can understand why you\u2019re acting like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung immediately shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like Son Chaeyoung!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Same, but why are you bringing this up now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar! If you don\u2019t like her, why are you working with her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>I frowned. Im Seoyoung paused. Her large eyes moved chaotically. Behind her, Lee Taehee and LJ had expressions that something was odd.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, stop it, dummy. I don\u2019t think he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ grabbed the back of Im Seoyoung\u2019s neck and dragged her back.</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe new actor you\u2019re assigned to, it\u2019s not Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Just where did you hear that from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing absent-mindedly, Lee Taehee told me the whole story. Hearing it, I was more dumbfounded. I took out my phone and showed them what I saved Son Chaeyoung\u2019s number, and this absurd incident came to an end.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoyoung, what did you say to me? What? Traitor? I\u2019m not even human?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed my gaze felt prickly as Im Seoyoung flinched as she read my mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmmm, oppa. My mind went blank, thinking that you were really bewitched by Son Chaeyoung. I really felt like the ground was collapsing. Since I wasn\u2019t in my right mind, can\u2019t you just act like you didn\u2019t hear anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuaah, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung dangled from my arm. Still, it seemed the misunderstanding was resolved as her expression as much brighter than before, even if she was stomping her feet. Lee Taehee and LJ relaxed their tense shoulders and watched Im Seoyoung\u2019s behavior.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person I\u2019m in charge of is Mr. Nam Joyoon. He\u2019s an actor I met on an independent film set a few days ago. Since he\u2019s not in our company, this is my personal matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I brought up Nam Joyoon, I observed Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, I stopped her from turning into an evil spirit. She was gradually returning to normal, though her expression was still complicated.</p><br/><p>Our gazes met. She became surprised. Her eyes shook like earthquakes. Immediately, she lowered her head. No, she was covering her face with both her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, why are you standing there like that? Was it because you thought it was Son Chaeyoung?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no. I\u2019m fin- It didn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way it didn\u2019t, look at your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>She pushed me away with her flustered voice.</p><br/><p>What kind of reaction was this? If it wasn\u2019t because of Son Chaeyoung, then was it because of Nam Joyoon?</p><br/><p>Since she was an actress and listened to me, I did expect that she would be more concerned than the other girls when I told her I would be working with another actor. Still, her reaction was just too strange.</p><br/><p>Tilting my head, I approached her. I could feel her agitation. Gripping the plastic bottle tightly, she stepped to the side. Then she hid between the new recruit, Lee Kwanwoo, who had been standing ready since a while ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you acting like this? Come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. My face is really weird because I\u2019m so uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the large recruit between us, we circled around twice like we were playing \u2018catch the dragon\u2019s tail\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour face isn\u2019t weird even if you covered with plastic wrap. So come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t have my face like this at a time like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind the new recruit\u2019s shoulder, Lee Songha mumbled as if she was ruined.</p><br/><p>After circling around a third time, I said,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you saying? What kind of time is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something like that. It\u2019s important to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to understand her, but I couldn\u2019t. It was too much for my mental state.</p><br/><p>Should I just grab and pull her out? Just as I was thinking this, LJ asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk Songha.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that even the other girls found us dumbfounding as their expressions were odd. I let out a sigh and looked at the new recruit. Hiding Lee Songha behind his back, he didn\u2019t move and simply blinked.</p><br/><p>Seeing him like this was so irritating that I unknowingly clicked my tongue. The new recruit became stiffer.</p><br/><p>Damn it. I was trying to maintain my image since he was my first junior, but it was ruined.</p><br/><p>\u201cKwanwoo, move aside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha immediately said. The new recruit, who was about to move aside, stopped in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to move aside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Lee Songha\u2019s voice escaped behind the new recruit, who didn\u2019t know what to do. I had no choice. Just as I was about to pull her out, Lee Songha turned around and fled in the opposite direction. She entered the gym, almost slamming into the door. I, no, everyone including me stared at the swaying gym door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think she\u2019s acting like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Songha expert. How would we know if you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ answered with narrow eyes.</p><br/><p>Beside her, Im Seoyoung mumbled, \u2018Is it that day? Are her hormones going out of control?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to her. I think it\u2019ll be better if you went than us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Taehee said while smiling faintly. I nodded and walked towards the gym. Then I suddenly recalled something I wanted to say and looked at the recruit.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall the agency and check the standby time for today\u2019s university event again. Check if there are any changes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patting the recruit\u2019s wide shoulder, I added,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, next time, if I tell you to move, move.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knocked on the women\u2019s changing room. Hurried steps halted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, what are you doing alone in there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m changing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she was hiding, she replied quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then I\u2019ll wait, so come out when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go on without me. I think I\u2019ll be around 30 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you making your clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 I think my underwear\u2019s disappeared, so I\u2019m looking for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her excuse was filled with determination to send me away first.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you acting like this because I am going to work with another actor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice flowed out hesitantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talked about scenarios and ate at your house. I was a little jealous that you seem closer to him than me. It\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to worry. I won\u2019t bother your work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo right now, I\u2019m a bit, narrow-minded\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. It definitely is concerning. I felt a bit upset when you hid behind the recruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha\u2019s voice, which crawled on the ground, perked up. When I thought about how her ears were strained behind the changing room door, a smile unknowing hung on my face. I checked my wristwatch and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have two hours before your next schedule, should we talk about scenarios in the van? While time is tight, it might be a nice change of pace if we\u2019re on the road\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door burst open. Lee Songha walked out wearing everyday clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a lie. Let\u2019s go, oppa. We don\u2019t have time to waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Subtly avoiding my gaze, Lee Songha held my clothes and urged me. I grinned as I began walking.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha followed after me with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Director Sung of Well-Made Production said,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe received PBS\u2019s Wednesday-Thursday national broadcasting schedule. We already sold right to YKTV in China. As soon as production is done, it\u2019ll be released in Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to him were the director and writer for the Korean-Chinese drama \u2018Royal Family\u2019. Besides them, Well-Made Production employees, well-dressed in suits, were looking in our direction.</p><br/><p>Of course, beside me were Kim Hyunjo, the Team 3 Leader, and Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did Ms. Songha feel about the first two parts of the script?\u201d</p><br/><p>Writer Jang, a woman in her forties wearing fancy earrings, asked.</p><br/><p>Unlike Writer Hong Jumi of Cat Guardian Ghost, who was a beginner, she was a famous writer with constant hits for seven years. Apparently, she was paid 40 million won<sup>{1}</sup> per episode or something.</p><br/><p>As soon as their gazes focused on her, Lee Songha swallowed a piece of fruit and replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was so fun that I read it all on the spot. To be honest, I already read the script with Sun- chief oppa. Since there are two lead couples, the story is abundant, and since it\u2019s romantic revenge plot, I was very interested in what happens next.\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced at me as she spoke. When I nodded, indicating she was doing a good job, a relaxed smile hung on her lips.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha continued by admiring the characters until her composed expression lit with excitement. Writer Jang, who was constantly evaluating Lee Songha with her gaze, nodded.</p><br/><p>Director Woo, whose had a bushy beard all the up to his sideburns, asked the next question,</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing Ms. Songha\u2019s previous work, you seemed proficient in English, how\u2019s your Chinese? Since your role is a global Korean actress, so there are quite a few Chinese lines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can hold simple conversations. I received lessons since my time as a trainee.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director let out an exclaim of admiration when he heard her answer. The Team 3 Leader added,</p><br/><p>\u201cThese days, whether it\u2019s idols or actors, expanding into China is vital.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true. That was why I was cramming English and Chinese lessons whenever I had the time to use later.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when does Neptune plan on expanding its activities to China?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are planning on holding a fan meeting around the time Cat Guardian Ghost releases in China. The reaction in China is quite good since their album was a success and because of Songha\u2019s drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of those from Well-Made Production became brighter.</p><br/><p>This felt good. Since the drama was produced beforehand, it was possible to adjust the schedule a little. If things worked out, we might even be able to film a movie concurrently. While I was thinking about our future schedule, Director Sung poured liquor in my empty glass as he asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jung. Do you know how many Korean-Chinese dramas will be released this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that there were seven, including Royal Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. So damn many. Our project has to do the best out them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After clinking our glasses, Director Sung chuckled as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease work hard to make our project as much of a success as Cat Guardian Ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about how Chief Jung Sunwoo\u2019s discerning eye is unbelievable. That Chief Jung\u2019s words might be more effective than placing a pig\u2019s head on a ritual table and praying for success.\u201d</p><br/><p>He only let me be after he heard that this drama would do well from my own mouth.</p><br/><p>Even after this, the mood of the meeting wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>Then, not long after, Lee Songha was officially cast in Royal Family.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The evening of the day Lee Songha stamped<sup>{2}</sup> the Well-Made Production contract, I brought Nam Joyoon to Pan Production.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I look weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon asked while we were in the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were staring at me. I wore clothes that suited the role since this was an audition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was looking since it suited you so well. If we were to judge by how one looked the part, we might not even need an audition. They might say that I actually brought a criminal instead of an actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nam Joyoon was standing, slightly leaning back, with his hands in his pockets.</p><br/><p>He wore a black hoodie that easily covered his small head, and his hair was slightly ruffled. His eyes were half-closed. His sharp chin moved irregularly as he was chewing gum.</p><br/><p>I unknowing exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more I see you, the better you look. To be honest, I was interested in this role because it fit well with your atmosphere, but I was worried that you might not be immersed in the role because it was too crazy. You\u2019re more well-mannered.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I said this, the elevator doors opened. Nam Joyoon separated from the wall. Then he placed his arm on my shoulder and whispered like a man planning a crime,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, chief. I\u2019ll do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tips of his lips under the hood rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cI became human with age.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> ~37,716 USD</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> Stamps can be used in lieu of signatures</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-109\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 109\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-111\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 111\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201333\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

Fans of that are here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff replied friendlily, but it lacked a sense of reality.</p><br/><p>I knew that Cat Guardian Ghost was being positively received in China. However, it was so well received that hundreds of fans gathered, giving her no choice but to leave secretly through the VIP exit?</p><br/><p>When it hadn\u2019t even been officially released in China yet?</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, everyone who will take the normal exit, please go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff urged us as if he was frustrated by how we were murmuring to each other in surprise.</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo came to his senses and gathered Neptune and Lee Kwanwoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides Songha, the other members will leave through the normal exit. If there are a lot of people, then there\u2019ll be reporters. This will be a good opportunity to promote them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also leave through the normal exit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Joowon said after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to feel like an international star even if it\u2019s like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Neptune and Mr. Im Joowon. Ms. Seo Eunkyo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go through the VIP exit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo said with her chin raised.</p><br/><p>Then, as if making an excuse, she added,</p><br/><p>\u201cI was a bit shocked from the hardcore fans the last time I came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the majority said they wanted to \u2018cosplay\u2019 as international stars and disappeared through the normal exit.</p><br/><p>Only a few people remained. I rolled my eyes as my gaze alternated between Lee Songha, Son Chaeyoung, and Seo Eunkyo.</p><br/><p>The ones who remained were a ridiculous bunch.</p><br/><p>As soon as we exited through the VIP exit, Lee Kwanwoo messaged me.</p><br/><p>-Chief! This place is no joke!</p><br/><p>It felt like his dying message.</p><br/><p>Anyways, I understood that the situation at the normal exit was \u2018no joke\u2019. I didn\u2019t know how he took it, but a slightly blurry picture was attached to his message. It was Neptune passing through the crowd with frightened faces.</p><br/><p>They could even use this as a poster for a zombie movie.</p><br/><p>I glanced at the signs people were holding and found one with Lee Songha\u2019s name on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, look at this. Your name\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at her because I didn\u2019t hear a reply, and she was lost in her own thoughts.</p><br/><p>I thought she was still stunned, but that wasn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>Her clear eyes were fixed on Son Chaeyoung\u2019s back as she walked in front of her. It seemed she was still on high alert. By herself. Son Chaeyoung, who I was worried would start a fight, didn\u2019t even look in our direction as she walked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSongha, what are you doing? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can. I\u2019m listening to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, okay. So what did I say just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I only heard your voice. It was too quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said honestly while reading my expression.</p><br/><p>While she wasn\u2019t comparable to Son Chaeyoung, she was still very difficult to understand.</p><br/><p>While she was in a situation where she might ascend as an international star in one go, in this situation that was like winning the lottery for a celebrity, she was thinking about something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha calmly said as she looked at my phone screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was the same, but I can after seeing the photo. Good lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>A staff talked about what he had heard from the airport employees.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was quite a solid fanbase of people who pirated the drama, but once promotions really began with Huai TV releasing a trailer and clips, it really began to spread. Fans of the drama are working hard online to make the drama a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huai TV was the online platform that bought rights to Cat Guardian Ghost.</p><br/><p>They started the fire, and the fans poured oil on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the Cat Guardian Ghost cast\u2019s popularity is rising to international star levels. I feel like this\u2019ll be huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>The future I had seen was the same.</p><br/><p>Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s lead and supporting actors became international stars overnight.</p><br/><p>Has the day arrived?</p><br/><p>We already informed the PR Team about the situation so we should hear back from them soon. Once we arrived at the hotel, I needed to discuss this sudden situation with Kim Hyunjo\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, I feel like you\u2019re exaggerating? What if they fall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo casually said.</p><br/><p>While her tone was light as though it was a joke, irritation and nastiness were clearly visible in her eyes. She looked like she wanted to say, \u2018What a joke! Do you think anyone can be an international star?\u2019</p><br/><p>She was like this for a while.</p><br/><p>Since the staff asked Lee Songha to use the VIP exit.</p><br/><p>I heard there was a law of conservation of nut cases. Was she all up in a fuss because Son Chaeyoung was quiet?</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Lee Songha wasn\u2019t a lead role anyways, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seo Eunkyo said while glancing at Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe the fans outside are waiting for Mr. Seo Jijoon? Because they think he arrived with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there definitely were a lot of people who came for Mr. Seo Jijoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member added as he gave a knowing smile like he knew she would act like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ms. Lee Songha\u2019s popularity is at the level of the lead actors. I saw the drama, and Jung Haewon\u2019s character is just so charming. Her acting was great, and above all, her looks were amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff coughed as he glanced at Lee Songha.</p><br/><p>I felt like the surrounding temperature rose because Seo Eunkyo glared at us with such a heated gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cA limousine is waiting for you outside the door so you can get on right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member told us as he stopped at the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight away. Or else they might chase you in taxis. Chinese fans are especially hardcore. You need to leave before they catch up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you for guiding us.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied.</p><br/><p>The chief from Team 2 was busy on the phone for a while now, and Seo Eunkyo\u2019s people were busy whispering to each other.</p><br/><p>Everyone put on their sunglasses. I put one on Lee Songha as well.</p><br/><p>An amazing sound erupted. One I couldn\u2019t tell whether it was a scream or a shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d</p><br/><p>We were led to a security guard who shouted at us in poor Korean.</p><br/><p>When I looked in the noisy direction, ten or so security guards were blocking people. They shouted Son Chaeyoung and Lee Songha\u2019s name. A few, realizing that Seo Jijoon wasn\u2019t here, cried out, shouting things I couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Though I knew Chinese fans had a fanatic side towards Korean stars, seeing it in person, their spirit was no joke. I saw quick-witted people rush towards us at incredible speeds when they heard the commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet in quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff shouted.</p><br/><p>Two long limousines were waiting nearby.</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung and the Team 2 chief got in the first one, and Seo Eunkyo\u2019s party, which consisted of four people, got in the second one. With no other option, I got in the first limousine with Lee Songha. As soon as I closed the door, the limousine drove off in a hurry.</p><br/><p>I let out a sigh after sitting down on a plush seat when something felt strange.</p><br/><p>The car was going backwards.</p><br/><p>Looking at it again, the seats were set up to face each other.</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue, thinking the mood would be wonderful throughout the ride.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, sit in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said while taking off her sunglasses.</p><br/><p>Before I could, Lee Songha asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI dislike looking at both of you, but I hate you more.\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally seemed like the real Son Chaeyoung.</p><br/><p>I was concerned she might erupt like the calm before the storm. This actually made me relax. I changed seats with Lee Songha and sat in front of Son Chaeyoung. This was probably better than having Son Chaeyoung and Lee Songha face each other.</p><br/><p>Even with a glance, I could tell there were simply too many throwable objects in here.</p><br/><p>The air was tense as though it would explode with a single spark.</p><br/><p>The Team 2 chief was the one who broke the silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Ms. Chaeyoung.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI received a call from the agency that handles your Chinese activities and he said the owner of the GHB Hotel\u2019s wish is to have a meal with you. If you give him a bit of your time, you\u2019ll receive a lifetime stay at the hotel as a presen-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said without batting an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t some weird meeting. There won\u2019t be any alcohol. He just wants to have lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my first time in this industry. There\u2019s no \u2018just wanting to have lunch\u2019. If we have lunch, he\u2019ll want to have dinner next time. Then he\u2019ll want to go for drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Team 2 chief licked his lips and tried to persuade her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe company won\u2019t stand it if he acts like that. But this person really isn\u2019t trying to pull any tricks. He\u2019s purely your fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll have a meal as a group in a restaurant. Don\u2019t set up a private meeting. Also, if I received things like \u2018lifetime stays\u2019 and stuff and rumors spread that I can be bought, don\u2019t you know things will be even more troublesome and dirty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it. Then let\u2019s do that. You kno-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to say the same thing, then don\u2019t even bring it up. You\u2019re only wasting your breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son Chaeyoung said in a temper before closing her eyes.</p><br/><p>It seemed the thing he wanted to talk about was the same thing as the Team 2 chief shut his lips.</p><br/><p>His thick double-eyelid eyes moved up and down.</p><br/><p>Then he stopped and looked at me before grinning.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I felt like I was on a state visit.</p><br/><p>It was my first time riding in a limousine, but I couldn\u2019t even describe the hotel we arrived at as luxurious. Before I could fully admire the awe of a 5-star hotel, a crowd of people rushed towards us.</p><br/><p>They were hotel employees, dozens of security guards, and employees of the Chinese agency affiliated with W&amp;U.</p><br/><p>After receiving more than enough greetings I could handle, we went up to the seventh floor.</p><br/><p>Familiar faces bustled in this wide, glittering hallway. They were the ones who went through the normal exit at the airport. I discovered Kim Hyunjo, Lee Kwanwoo, and Neptune and approached them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou arrived before us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just arrived as well. We pushed our way through a war zone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo said with an exhausted face.</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung, whose face was red with excitement, snatched Lee Songha, telling her that she was almost stomped to death when they left through the normal exit and how people were calling out Lee Songha\u2019s name. She also asked about what the VIP exit was like.</p><br/><p>Seeing her chat without rest, I unconsciously examined my surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we being too loud in this hotel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The hotel completely emptied the seventh and eighth floors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey vacated it for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they did. That\u2019s why everyone\u2019s in a fuss trying to choose their rooms.\u201d</p><br/><p>They vacated two floors for us to use?</p><br/><p>Was this common?</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo shrugged as he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably because of Yoon Taekyung. They sometimes do this for true top stars. Apparently, crazy fans sometimes hide in the rooms so they vacate entire floors for complete security.\u201d</p><br/><p>The treatment of international stars when they go to China was incredible. I had only heard stories about it.</p><br/><p>Seeing it in person, I wondered what kind of world we lived in.</p><br/><p>Leaving our bags in our rooms, I went to the eighth floor with Chief Sung.</p><br/><p>Royal Family\u2019s Director Woo and the production staff from Well-Made Production had arrived ahead of us to look for good filming sets.</p><br/><p>I greeted Director Woo, whose eyes were sunken from drinking all night, I met with the production staff. After exchanging a few words, I was about to go back down to the lower floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask something from the two of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A staff member with her long hair in a ponytail held us back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMs. Son Chaeyoung\u2019s here, and Mr. Seo Jijoon will be arriving soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded, the production staff member asked with begging eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you ask them to make a cameo appearance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA cameo appearance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We were about to call W&amp;U because we needed a cameo for a top star part. It\u2019ll be the best if Ms. Son Chaeyoung and Mr. Seo Jijoon make an appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>It was late into our first night in China.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even have time to breathe because we were so busy organizing the schedule.</p><br/><p>There was the Neptune fan meeting schedule.</p><br/><p>There was also the Cat Guardian Ghost schedule that would take place in seven regions, starting in Beijing then to Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong and others.</p><br/><p>We also had an imminent photo and first filming for Royal Family as well.</p><br/><p>Putting how busy it was aside, the schedules were so complicatedly tangled that organizing it without any mistakes was a difficult task. Still, I greeted people with a smile thanks to Cat Guardian Ghost\u2019s popularity and the entire day felt like the night before a celebration.</p><br/><p>I even drank in the bar in the end since today was a good day.</p><br/><p>I saw the people from Huai TV off and tried to sober up outside. Then I went up to the seventh floor again. It seemed other people had already entered their rooms as the busy hallway was now quiet.</p><br/><p>Only one person, Son Chaeyoung, slowly walked back and forth in the hallway.</p><br/><p>Like she was looking for something.</p><br/><p>Our eyes met as I passed her.</p><br/><p>No, I thought I passed her, but Son Chaeyoung came back after taking a few steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was doing her best to ignore me the entire day, yet what was this now?</p><br/><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the Royal Family production company wanted me to make a cameo appearance. But why didn\u2019t you ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you already refused.\u201d</p><br/><p>Definitely.</p><br/><p>When I asked the company, they said it was fine if the actors agreed.</p><br/><p>That was why I played a game of rock-paper-scissors with Chief Sung. Since I got goosebumps just thinking of asking Son Chaeyoung to make a cameo appearance, I wanted to drop my chances by half.</p><br/><p>It was my first time playing such a nerve-wracking game of rock-paper-scissors.</p><br/><p>It was also my first time celebrating my win.</p><br/><p>While I received a positive reply from Seo Jijoon, who was in Korea, I heard Chief Sung went to ask Son Chaeyoung personally.</p><br/><p>I heard he was refused immediately, in less than a second.</p><br/><p>I recalled Chief Sung\u2019s soul-deprived face when Son Chaeyoung stomped her heels on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you asked me, I might have said yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Well then, will you-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-122\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 122\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-124\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 124\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201359\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

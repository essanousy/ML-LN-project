This was frustrating.</p><br/><p>So it wasn\u2019t Director Joo Jaechan\u2019s scenario?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t your scenario?\u201d<sup>{1}</sup></p><br/><p>\u2026 Huh?</p><br/><p>Did \u2018I\u2019 just speak?</p><br/><p>The words \u2018I\u2019 thought had come out of my future self\u2019s mouth. Without a single difference. Was it a coincidence? Was it just incredible timing? I gulped anxiously. I tasted the disgusting smell of alcohol from my mouth.</p><br/><p>It felt like I had actually gulped just now. Was it also a coincidence?</p><br/><p>Maybe I should try it once more?</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>I tried to speak whilst perking my ears.</p><br/><p>However, my voice simply echoed in my mind. I tried again. I tried to talk to Director Joo Jaechan and singing the \u2018ABCs\u2019 and national anthem. I even shouted, but there was no sound.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any, but it was still different from before.</p><br/><p>The breeze on my skin felt so real that it prickled my skin. My heartbeat quickened. My voice crawled up my throat, almost speaking, but failed at the last obstacle.</p><br/><p>Just a little more, if I try a little more, maybe\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>My collar was involuntarily grabbed. Then I was pulled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my scenario. It\u2019s fucking mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Joo Jaechan said in a seething voice right in front of me. The stench of alcohol overwhelmed me. Although he had looked like a man suffering from starvation and thirst, he suddenly looked satiated.</p><br/><p>An odd case of madness lingered in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMine. My scenario\u2026! It\u2019s mine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>My lungs were suddenly filled with air. Struggling, I coughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou scared me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWater, please have some water. Here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you made me bite my tongue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung Uimin spoke one after each other. I instantly downed the cup of cold water Chief Jung handed me. I even crunched on the ice. Chief Lee Bongjoon, who stuck out his tongue with a frown, looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it all of a sudden? Were you dreaming with your eyes open? Or did you see a ghost\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly pushed the scenarios towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey- I mean, Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, what do you think will be a hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just thought that he might be possessed or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their voices muffled in my ears. My head felt like it had inflated like a balloon. I jolted to my feet with the mug. The chair fell back and crashed on the floor. Surprised, the two stopped whispering and stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had something caught in my throat. I\u2019ll be back after drinking some water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Something was caught?\u201d</p><br/><p>I left the meeting room, leaving behind their disappointed faces. Employee\u2019s gazes stuck to me everywhere I walked. I went straight to the drinking fountain and drank multiple glasses of cold water, My mind cleared a little. I filled my empty cup as I thought things through.</p><br/><p>What was that just now?</p><br/><p>It was only for a moment, but I felt a sense of realism from my future vision.</p><br/><p>It had never been like this before. Every time I saw the future, I was like a puppet. I couldn\u2019t do anything I wanted. The only things allowed were seeing, hearing, and feeling.</p><br/><p>But just now\u2026</p><br/><p>My heart raced so fast it felt like it would explode.</p><br/><p>If\u2026</p><br/><p>If I could move the way I wanted in my future visions\u2026</p><br/><p>If that was possible, I could make my family, celebrities, only walk a path of success. Whether it was a project, song, show, or anything else, I could figure out which would be successes and failures through my visions.</p><br/><p>Also, which celebrities would succeed or fall.</p><br/><p>And who would become my friend and who would be my enemy.</p><br/><p>There would be no need to try to piece the scraps of information obtained through my visions like now. I wouldn\u2019t need to worry and carefully examine every step I took either.</p><br/><p>Since the future\u2026 would be in my hands.</p><br/><p>I filled my empty cup once more. I rinsed my overheated head with cold water.</p><br/><p>Why did this suddenly happen? Was there some sort of sign?</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, I had three future visions in the past few days. I met Director Joo Jaechan in two of them like the visions would guide me to Director Joo Jaechan and City Jungle.</p><br/><p>So that I could change my future by getting them both and not have my next project flop and my nickname \u2018Midas\u2019s Hand\u2019 rust away.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 Wait.</p><br/><p>All three visions I had were full of static.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t my last future change?</p><br/><p>The clear vision from twenty years in the future was always fixed no matter how I changed the present, but the static-filled ones changed as I changed the present. Like how I saw the vision where Jung Jae committed suicide after seeing the one where Pretty Girls succeed.</p><br/><p>After seeing the futures with Director Joo Jaechan and City Jungle, I definitely decided to get them in my hands, but why did I still see a vision where I failed to get City Jungle? Why didn\u2019t it change?</p><br/><p>Did it mean I tossed City Jungle away and picked a different one?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Team Leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice pierced my ears. When I turned around, Lee Kwanwoo was standing there with a taken aback expression. Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader were also looking at me with bulging eyes. Other employees were gathered around me like they were seeing a spectacle.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam leader, are you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Kwanwoo and Kim Hyunjo asked at the same time. I shook my head as I answered,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re fine, why are you blankly standing there after breaking a cup?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked down. The floor was soaked, and the cup that had just been in my hand was shattered all over the floor. When did I drop it?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I must have been lost in my thoughts for a moment. I\u2019ll clean it up right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>I moved to find a broom or tissues when the floor disappeared. My vision turned black.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me, again?!</p><br/><p>I opened my eyes.</p><br/><p>The noisy employees were nowhere to be seen. All I saw in front of me was a window. It seemed to be night as it was dark outside. It was raining heavily. Lightning split the cloudy sky.</p><br/><p>What kind of vision was this? And where was I?</p><br/><p>Damn it, my head ached.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My mind jolted the moment I groaned and grabbed my forehead.</p><br/><p>My hand moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>I unconsciously turned towards the voice before becoming shocked again. My head moved as well. My body moved at will. I raised my hands and waved them in front of me. I even tried bending each finger. It worked.</p><br/><p>My mind was a bit hazy and my body felt heavy, but my body was definitely moving at will. Excitement surged like a tidal wave.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy hands are moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, are you okay? Why are you acting like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cABCDEFG. Until that day when\u2026 I can even speak.\u201d <sup>{2}</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard a frightened voice. It was Lee Songha. Panic and worry were clearly evident on her face. I even saw Im Seoyoung, LJ, and Lee Taehee. They were all looking at me with oddly contorted expressions.</p><br/><p>Lee Songha grabbed my hands.</p><br/><p>I could clearly see tears pooling in Im Seoyoung\u2019s eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>Wait, why is there no static?</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, you\u2019re scaring us! Can you see me? You know who I am, right? How many fingers am I holding up?\u201d</p><br/><p>I blankly stared at the sobbing Im Seoyoung. Lee Songha quickly turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go bring the nurse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped the situation and looked around me. I was lying on a comfortable bed. There was a needle in my right arm, and I saw an IV to the side. The blanket on top of me was branded with the hospital name. I was in a hospital room. A private one.</p><br/><p>I clutched the bed as I raised myself up. My vision was still clear, with no sign of any static.</p><br/><p>What the heck? Was this not the future?</p><br/><p>I licked my dry lips and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat day is it today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears finally fell from Im Seoyoung\u2019s eyes. At the same, Lee Songha ran out of the room, shouting for a nurse. LJ, who had a frown on her face, replied as she waved her hand in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fainted after collapsing at work. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fainted?</p><br/><p>As soon as I asked back, Lee Songha ran back in with a nurse in tow. I saw Lee Kwanwoo and Kim Hyunjo behind them. I left my body in the nurse\u2019s care as I heard the whole story. When I fell after stepping on the wet floor, I lost consciousness and was sent o the hospital.</p><br/><p>Oh my god.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou slept for half a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo, with bags under his eyes, sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI talked to the doctor, and he said that you were fine aside from the few scratches you received when you fell. I didn\u2019t call your family since he said that you were probably just sleeping after fainting. The doctor said that it was probably sleep deprivation or exhaustion after hearing your work schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, to have fainted at work\u2026</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Im Seoyoung joined in. Her eyes were moist.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not fine. I think he hurt his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he hit it when he fell? He was spouting nonsense as soon as he woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>When even LJ joined the conversation, Kim Hyunjo tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He didn\u2019t his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cABCDEFG. Until that day when.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said. Like he just woke up after being put under anesthesia. Shouldn\u2019t he be checked once more?\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly waved my hands when they started talking about MRIs and stuff. I told them that my mind was preoccupied because I had an incredibly vivid dream. Only after telling them that it was a nightmare where I couldn\u2019t see or speak like Helen Keller did the agitated mood finally calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunwoo, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Hyunjo paused in the middle of his sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind. Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow. Don\u2019t think about work tonight and just rest with the IV.\u201d</p><br/><p>He patted my shoulder with a complicated expression before giving Neptune a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just leave and not bother him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a little lon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him rest. You are also making a comeback the day after tomorrow. You have a ton to do right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls whispered to each other for a while before lackadaisically walking out. They all seemed like they wanted to say something to me. Im Seoyoung spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cRest well, oppa. You don\u2019t need to worry about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are so many people counting the days as they wait for us to release new songs. Since you\u2019ve set it all up, how can the album fail- not do well? Everyone says that it\u2019ll be a minor hit at worst!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it flops, it\u2019s because my songs were lacking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the will of the heavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>LJ correct Lee Taehee after poking her sides. Im Seoyoung nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! We need to blame the heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what they said, but they all left with grim expressions.</p><br/><p>While the other girls were leaving, Lee Songha approached me. Her face was still full of worry. There were also flashes of regret and guilt. Someone might think that I had a terminal illness.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, you know how I said I would do any project you picked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to cancel that.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cProjects should be decided on by the actor and their manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Songha added as if to emphasize her intentions,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not your fault if it fails.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was wondering why she was suddenly saying that\u2026</p><br/><p>-Team leader, is it true you have a panic disorder?</p><br/><p>Im Joowon whispered with a worried voice on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did that nonsense come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Apparently, you suddenly went over to the water fountain while panting and downed six or seven cups of water consecutively. Your hands trembled before dropping your cup, and you fainted after trying to run away as people started to gather. Is that not it?</p><br/><p>I felt like I was about to go crazy.</p><br/><p>-That rumor is spreading in the company. That you developed a panic disorder from the pressure and anxiety now that you are suddenly managing so many people after becoming a team leader.</p><br/><p>I really felt like I was about to go crazy.</p><br/><p>I dissuaded him from visiting and hung up after telling him I was fine multiple times.</p><br/><p>I checked my phone, and it was full of missed calls and messages. There was nothing more to say about the chiefs at work, but I also received some from Nam Joyoon, Seo Jijoon, Pretty Girls, and Song Inho. After looking through them, it seemed they had visited while I was unconscious.</p><br/><p>I even saw Son Chaeyoung amongst the missed calls. I didn\u2019t know how far the rumors about my supposed panic disorder had spread.</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and checked the remainder of my messages before pausing. There was a long message from an unknown number. I pressed the \u2018call\u2019 button as soon as I read it.</p><br/><p>-Hello?</p><br/><p>Someone picked up as soon as it started to ring. It was a woman\u2019s voice. She seemed nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Director Oh Hyunkyung?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yes, this is Oh Hyunkyung. Is this perhaps Team Leader Jung Sunwoo\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m calling you after reading your message. I wanted to learn more about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Ah, that is\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how you found out\u2026 But I heard that you talked about my scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour scenario?\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied immediately.</p><br/><p>-Yes, City Jungle.</p><br/><p><sup>{1}</sup> The two lines are the same in Korean.</p><br/><p><sup>{2}</sup> I used \u2018ABC\u2019 over the Korean alphabet but used an English translation of the Korean national anthem.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-197\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 197\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/top-management-chapter-199\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 199\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"201508\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}
